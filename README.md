# Zebra Extras

These directories contain artifacts related to the RDSS Zebra software which were not included in the [Zebra source repository](https://github.com/ncareol/zebra).

- **doc**: documentation
- **project**: zebra display configurations for various projects and datasets
- **nondist**: source code for ingestors and other tools which were not part of the normal zebra distribution
- **cdrom**: files related to CDROM dataset distributions

These were migrated from EOL subversion using [zebra-to-git](zebra-to-git) and [zebra-doc.rules](zebra-doc.rules).  The EOL subversion URL is http://svn.eol.ucar.edu/svn/rdss/trunk/zebra.
