<H1><A NAME="HDT0"> <paranum><B>CHAPTER 1 </B> Introduction to the zebra advanced users manual.</A></H1>

<H3><A NAME="HDR1">  1.1  Introductory remarks</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>This manual is intended for advanced users of the zebra system. It covers in depth the structure of the system and how to configure it for specific uses, with a bias towards the more common analysis, non-real-time mode. For information on real-time Zebra set-ups, see the guide to <I>Real-time Zebra</I>. As with all zebra documentation, this manual is under continuous work, and will probably always be a little out of date. Likewise, those who wish to contribute to this manual are strongly encouraged to do so.
<P>The tone of this manual attempts to be a cross between a conversational discussion and a reference manual. Thus some concepts will be introduced in general terms long before they are covered more rigorously. The hope is that the reader will be able to go through the manual from beginning to end and, while perhaps skipping some of the more detailed material, come out with a solid understanding of how the zebra system is structured.
<P>The following chapter will discuss the zebra system as a whole, with emphases on demonstrating how the various zebra processes fit together. The messaging system will be introduced as the glue that holds all the pieces in place, and most of the pieces (processes) will be introduced in general terms.

<P>Next comes a discussion of how the zebra user interface works. Zebra's interface to the user is managed through a complicated interaction among multiple processes, and can be daunting at the first encounter. This chapter will attempt to take some of the stress out of configuring the zebra interface.
<P>Most of the rest of the manual is dedicated to in-depth discussion of the individual processes that make up zebra. It is in these chapters that you can read all about the various commands, plot description parameters, widgets, and so on.
<H3><A NAME="HDR2">  1.2  Changes for 4.2</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>This section lists some changes in this manual since the 4.1 release.

<UL>
<P><LI>Details about real-time processes, such as the Archiver, ingestors, and monitors, have been moved to a separate manual, <I>Guide to Real-time Zebra</I>. The separation makes this manual more manageable and limits the information it contains to that needed by the majority of post-project, analysis installations.
<BR>
<P><LI><A HREF="Structure.html#REF62427">Section 2.2 on page 12</A> now describes the implementation of message manager sessions and address maps, which allow multiple sessions on a single host to communicate through the loopback protocol and unique port numbers. Likewise message manager sessions can be known by a descriptive, unique <I>session</I> name rather than the host name. Also, see the new command-line options for mstatus and msg_ping.
<BR>
<P><LI>The data store daemon accepts config variable settings on the command line, and a new flag prevents automatic data directory creation.
<BR>
<P><LI>See the documentation of the new relaxed plot description syntax in <A HREF="UserInterface.html#REF73665">Section 4.3 on page 72</A>.
<BR>
<P><LI><A HREF="Displaymgr.html#REF70399">Section 5.5 on page 94</A> includes updates for the recent changes to the time control widget.
<BR></UL>


<H3><A NAME="HDR3">  1.3  Notation</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>The typewriter font is used extensively in this manual to indicate literal text either entered into the computer or received from it. In examples, text which is intended to be replaced with a user-specific value is shown in a <I>slanted typewriter</I> font instead. Finally, optional values are shown in square brackets. No zebra command or configuration option ever takes square brackets as a parameter --- they should never actually be typed by the user.
