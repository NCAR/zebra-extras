<TITLE> <paranum><B>CHAPTER 3 </B> Ingest Modules</TITLE>
<H1><A NAME="REF31609"> <paranum><B>CHAPTER 3 </B> Ingest Modules</A></H1>

<P>This appendix provides a brief listing and descriptions of the ingest modules included in Zebra Release 4.2. All of these modules will compile under SunOS 4.1.x and GNU C. Most of the others are known to compile under the other systems and compilers as well. Those modules that do not compile on a particular system are noted explicitly.
<H3><A NAME="HDR0">  3.1  The Purpose of Ingest Modules</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>An ingest module is a program which reads data from some external source in some foreign format, and then creates from that data a DataChunk which can be described, transported, and stored through the Zebra DataStore. As there is no universal format for meteorological data, there is likewise no universal ingest module. Instead, ingest modules have been written for literally dozens of formats and data sources over Zebra's lifetime.

<P>Almost exclusively, an ingest module is written for a particular task at hand at a particular time. The task can be a quick-and-dirty collection of data fields, and the time can be the middle of an intense field project where everything has been designed around a specific, one-time, and inflexible set-up. The ingest modules are included in the Zebra distribution in case one of them has some usefulness for a particular site or application. Likely as not, the ingest module will need to be modified to suit the particular need, but an existing module is a much better launch point than no module at all. The ingest modules can also serve as examples of using the DataStore programming interface to manipulate and ingest a wide variety of types of data from an equally wide range of sources.
<P>Countless other ingest modules have been written for Zebra which were not included in this release. These modules may be older code which has not been maintained for lack of a need, or they may be modules developed by some other project which are not officially part of the Zebra mainstream development. If you need to ingest data for which an ingest module does not exist in this release, contact one of the persons mentioned in the "Whom to Contact" section of the <I>Installation Manual</I>. It is possible that the ingest module required can be obtained elsewhere.

<HR>
<P>Following is a list of the ingest modules included in Release 4.2, along with a brief description. For all of these modules, the final word on purpose and application can be found in the source code itself, though some of the programs will also print usage information when given the `-h' option on the command line. The source directories reside under zebra/src/ingest in the Zebra distribution tree. The left column of <A HREF="modules.html#REF34407">Table 1</A> gives the name of each module directory; the center column lists the ingest programs built within each directory; and the right column supplies a brief description of each ingest program's use.
