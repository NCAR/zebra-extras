<H3><A NAME="HDR0">  3.1  The Boundary DataChunk Class</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>The boundary data class (class identifier DCC_Boundary, subclass of DCC_Transparent) is oriented toward the representation of data in the form of outlines or boundaries---essentially a series of locations in physical space. It is a relatively simple class, with just a couple of methods for storing boundaries into data chunks and getting them back out again.
<P>To store a boundary into a data chunk, use dc_BndAdd() as follows:
<PRE>
<B>void 
dc_BndAdd (dc, when, platform, points, npoint)
DataChunk *dc;
ZebTime *when;
PlatformId platform;
Location *points;
int npoint;
</PRE>
<P></B>Where <B>dc</B> is a data chunk which is a subclass of DCC_Boundary, <B>when</B> is the time associated with this boundary, <B>platform</B> is the ID of the platform associated with this boundary---this should generally be the same as the platform which appears in the dc_Platform field, <B>points</B> is the series of points which makes up the boundary, and <B>npoint</B> is the number of points in the boundary.

<P>To retrieve a boundary from a data chunk, use the dc_BndGet() function:
<PRE>
<B>Location *
dc_BndGet (dc, sample, npoint)
DataChunk *dc;
int sample, *npoint;
</PRE>
<P></B>The return value is a pointer to the series of points corresponding to the given <B>sample</B> index in <B>dc</B>; the number of points will be stored into <B>npoint</B>.
<H3><A NAME="HDR1">  3.2  The Location DataChunk Class</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>The location class (identifier DCC_Location) is a very simple subclass of DCC_Transparent, useful when the only desired information is a time series of locations. This class may be used, for example, to represent a track of a moving observation platform for which no other data is desired or available.
<P>About the only thing that can be done with this class is to store or fetch locations. Use dc_LocAdd() to add a location to a data chunk:
<PRE>
<B>void
dc_LocAdd (dc, when, loc)
DataChunk *dc;
ZebTime *when;
Location *loc;
</PRE>
<P></B>Where <B>dc</B> is a data chunk which is a subclass of DCC_Location, <B>when</B> is the time associated with this location, and <B>loc</B> is the location itself.
<P>To retrieve a location from a data chunk, use dc_LocGet().
<PRE>
<B>int dc_LocGet (dc, sample, when, loc)
DataChunk *dc;
int sample;
ZebTime *when;
Location *loc;
</PRE>
<P></B>Where <B>dc</B> is the data chunk, and <B>sample</B> is the sample of interest. The location and its associated time will be returned in <B>loc</B> and <B>when</B>, respectively.
<P>Since location data chunks are subclasses of DCC_Transparent, you may also use dc_GetLoc() and dc_GetTime() to get the location and time information independently.
