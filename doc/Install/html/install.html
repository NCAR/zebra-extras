<P>This manual provides the minimum but complete information and instructions required for installing Zebra. The intent is to install Zebra as quickly and as conveniently as possible. The first chapter outlines the hardware and software requirements; read this chapter to make sure all of the necessary libraries and utilities have been installed on your system. The following chapters give step-by-step instructions, from acquiring the Zebra software and supporting libraries, to configuring the distribution, to finally compiling and installing the system. The installation instructions assume a working knowledge of an editor, such as vi or emacs, and one of the UNIX command shells. Limited knowledge about tar(1), compress(1), and make(1) may also be useful.
<P>For a guide to the documentation included in this release, see the <I>Introducing Zebra</I> guide. Questions, problems, comments, and bug reports can be sent to one of the contact persons listed in <A HREF="install.html#REF38563">Section 13,  "Whom to Contact", on page 43.</A>
<P><A HREF="install.html#REF12734">Section 5, "Installing the Binary Distribution"</A>, gives instructions for installing the binary distribution of Zebra. <A HREF="install.html#REF31635">Section 7, "Acquiring Third-Party Software"</A>, begins the complete instructions for configuring and compiling the source distribution. After following the full installation instructions for Zebra 4.2 at least once, for future re-installations you may wish to refer to the summary given in <A HREF="smry-appndx.html#REF10525">Appendix B,  "Summary of the Installation Steps", on page 53.</A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR0">  1.  System Requirements</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>Zebra is designed to compile and run on UNIX platforms with the X Window System. The software is written to be portable among the variety of machine architectures which support variants of the UNIX operating system. However, as the adage goes, there is no such thing as portable software, only software which has been ported.

<H4><A NAME="HDR1">  1.1  Supported Systems</A></H4>
<P>Zebra is being supported for the combinations of architectures, operating systems, and compilers listed in <A HREF="install.html#REF46828">Table 1</A>. Zebra has been ported to each of these systems, and should port to similar systems as well. At present these are the only systems accessible to Zebra developers for porting and testing Zebra; consequently, assistance with other types of systems will inevitably be limited.

<P>Note that Sun 4 and Sun multi-processor (MP) machines fall into the category of SPARC architectures.
<P>Zebra has been built with both the Slackware and Debian Linux distributions. Though not exactly similar, Zebra should successfully build on both. Also, the Linux binary distribution uses ELF.
<H4><A NAME="HDR2">  1.2  Hardware Requirements</A></H4>
<P>Zebra requires the following hardware.

<UL>
<P><LI>Sun SPARC, SGI, or HP 9000 Series 700 workstation, or an Intel-based PC running Linux.
<BR>
<P><LI>Minimum of 8 MB of RAM, though 16 MB or more is highly recommended.
<BR>
<P><LI>Minimum of 8 MB of disk space for source code, 32 MB for compiled code, and approximately 40 to 50 MB for installed binaries and libraries.
<BR>
<P><LI>Sufficient disk space to store data.
<BR></UL>


<H4><A NAME="HDR3">  1.3  Software Requirements</A></H4>
<P>Zebra requires the following software.

<UL>
<P><LI>Operating System: Sun OS 4.1.1 or higher, Solaris 2.x, IRIX 5.x, HP-UX 9.0, or Linux 1.1.x or higher.
<BR>

<P><LI>X Window System server and libraries: MIT Version 11 Release 4 or higher, or OpenWindows 3.0. MIT Release 6 has been tested on Solaris and SunOS 4.1.3.
<BR>
<P><LI>MIT Athena Widget set. This set is provided with MIT X11, Open Windows, and IRIS. <B>For HP-UX</B>, both the Athena Widgets and the MIT X11 libraries can be found on the <I>InterWorks Contributed Software Library</I> CD-ROM.
<BR></UL>


<P>The following are required only if you will be building Zebra from the source distribution:

<UL>
<P><LI>C compiler: The Gnu GCC (public domain C compiler) is recommended, but the system vendor's compiler will suffice.
<BR>
<P><LI>FORTRAN 77 compiler. As of version 4.2, the GNU g77 compiler may be used.
<BR>
<P><LI>NCAR RDSS Library Package, available from RDP, unless you have a Zebra distribution which includes the required RDSS libraries. As of version 4.2, these libraries are included with the source distribution.
<BR>
<P><LI>The NetCDF library from Unidata.
<BR></UL>


<P>Depending upon the features desired in your particular Zebra installation, the following software may be required:

<UL>
<P><LI>The map projection library libproj.a. This library is available from the ATD distribution site, or from kai.er.usgs.gov.
<BR>
<P><LI>The Hierarchical Data Format library, HDF, is available from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Source code and documentation for HDF are on 
<BR><PRE>

<UL>
<P><LI>The radar ingestor, which for the vast majority of sites will be useless, requires the PCAP library from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. FTP the library from ftp.ee.lbl.gov.
<BR>
</UL>


<H4><A NAME="HDR4">  1.4  Disk Space Requirements</A></H4>
<P>A binary-only installation will require about 75 Megabytes of disk space: 50 to 70 MB for the executables, and less than 10 MB for the libraries and header files. If compiling dynamically linked executables from a source distribution, the binary installation will be smaller, from 30 to 50 MB for executables. However, the build in the source tree can require up to 100 MB during the compilation, depending upon which modules are compiled and installed. After cleaning the build tree the source takes up less than 15 MB.
<H4><A NAME="HDR5">  1.5  Recommended Hardware and Software</A></H4>
<P>The hardware and software below is recommended for improving the performance and effectiveness of the Zebra system.

<UL>
<P><LI>Color or greyscale monitor. (Highly recommended.) Zebra will not work properly if your display does not provide an 8-bit visual.
<BR>
<P><LI>X Shared Memory extension, which requires support for System V shared memory in the system kernel.
<BR>
<P><LI>A C++ compiler, for compiling dsmanage and tapeindex. Currently this code can only be compiled with the GNU g++ compiler and libg++ library.
<BR>
<P><LI>The Mosaic World Wide Web client from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, which Zebra can use as its help interface. As of version 4.2, the netscape browser (from ftp.netscape.com) may also be used (but version 1.1 or higher is required).
<BR></UL>


<P>A few modifications may be necessary in the machine's kernel and system resource files to improve Zebra's performance. <A HREF="install.html#REF65572">Section 12, "Tuning the Operating System"</A>, covers these modifications.
<H3><A NAME="HDR6">  2.  What to do with Old Versions of Zebra</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>If you are installing Zebra for the first time, then you do not need to read this section---in fact, little of this section will make sense; continue with <A HREF="install.html#REF21030">Section 3</A>, below. Otherwise, if you already have a version of Zebra installed and in use at your site, you may be wondering what to do about existing project configurations and data.

<P>Before installing the new version of Zebra, be sure to keep the old copy around as a backup. Do not erase any older versions until the latest version installs correctly and is given some time to be used and thoroughly tested. If the location of the Zebra binary directory changes, remember to update any PATH variables which might still refer to the old binary directory.
<P>A very simple but effective method of managing different versions places all of the version trees in one directory. If an older version of Zebra resides in /usr/local/src/zebra, rename that directory to include the version number. The example below assumes that release 4.1 is being replaced.
<PRE>
shell% cd /usr/local/src
shell% mv zebra zebra-4.1
</PRE>
<P>Now the 4.2 Zebra tar files can be extracted into the directory /usr/local/src/zebra.
<H4><A NAME="HDR7">  2.1  What To Do About Existing Configurations</A></H4>
<P>It is likely that the old project configurations will be compatible with the new Zebra programs and library files. However, compatibility cannot be absolutely guaranteed. If you have made no local customizations to the project configurations, the best course of action is to forget about the old configurations and begin using the newer ones. The configurations distributed with Zebra 4.2 take advantage of many new Zebra features which will provide better flexibility and performance, and their functionality should supercede that of the older configurations. If there are only a few local changes, then it might still be easier to start over with the new project configurations and make the local changes again. The new configurations have changed drastically and merging them with the local configuration changes could be futile, or at least unreasonable. The <I>Zebra Release Notes</I> give a summary of the changes and features in the new project configurations.
<P>If you have made significant local changes to the older project configurations, there may be a problem carrying those changes into the latest version of the configurations. First, run Zebra with the new configurations and see if perhaps the new configurations do not now satisfy the needs which originally motivated your local changes. If so, or if the new configurations are at least close to the desired effect, then start with the new configurations and make the desired changes from there, abandoning the older configurations.

<P>Some configuration customizations are naturally easy to integrate with new configurations. For example, display configurations can be added either to the DisplayConfigs file or the display configuration directory, usually <I>projectdir</I>/dconfig. Plot description files can be added to the plot description directory. New icons can be added or edited in the library directory. If your local configuration changes are more extensive than these mentioned here, you may need to contact one of the persons listed in <A HREF="install.html#REF38563">Section 13,  "Whom to Contact", on page 43.</A>
<H4><A NAME="REF26403">  2.2  What To Do About Existing Data</A></H4>
<P>Existing data files will work just fine with Zebra 4.2. However, if you currently have a version of Zebra which uses cache files (see the Zebra<I> Advanced User's Manual</I>), you may notice lots of messages in the Event Logger saying "cache version mismatch". Zebra 4.2 uses a newer version of the DataStore protocol, and so the DataStore daemon suspects the cache files to be out of date and consequently ignores them. The outdated cache files simply cause Zebra's start-up to take longer than usual. 
<P>The cache files can be updated by telling the DataStore daemon to write new ones. Once Zebra 4.2 is installed and running for a particular project, enter the following command at the shell prompt:
<PRE>
zrun DS_Daemon cache
</PRE>
<P>If zrun cannot be found, make sure the Zebra binary directory is in your path. Also, depending upon the project configuration, the cache files may be automatically updated the first time you exit normally from Zebra. Different project data directories can be updated only while Zebra is running that project configuration.
<H3><A NAME="REF21030">  3.  How to Get Zebra</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>This section describes all that is involved in actually acquiring a copy of the Zebra distribution.
<H4><A NAME="HDR8">  3.1  Where to Get It</A></H4>
<P>Zebra may be acquired either on tape or through File Transfer Protocol (FTP) from the Research Data Program (RDP) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Contact one of the persons mentioned in <A HREF="install.html#REF38563">Section 13, "Whom to Contact"</A>, for further instructions. The Zebra distribution is not made available via anonymous ftp so that RDP can keep track of who has acquired the software and estimate the level of support which may be needed in the future.

<H4><A NAME="HDR9">  3.2  What to Get</A></H4>
<P>Several compressed tar files comprise the full Zebra 4.2 release. These can be divided into three categories: documentation, project configurations, and software. The software itself is available in two forms: binary and source. The names of the tar files and the directories each contains are given in <A HREF="install.html#REF85314">Table 2</A>.

</PRE>
<P><A HREF="install.html#REF20940">Section 4, "The Zebra Directory Tree"</A>, provides an overview of the directories and their contents. At a minimum retrieve the documentation tar file, in which you will find helpful Zebra manuals (such as this installation manual). To install and run Zebra, you will also need either the source tar file or the binary tar file for your machine architecture. The following section gives some advice on whether the source or binary distribution will be more appropriate for your site.
<P>The project configuration tar file contains setup and dataset information for several field projects. If you wish to run Zebra with an existing project configuration, such as FEST, TRMM, or COARE, you need to acquire and install the project tar file. The <I>Release Notes</I> contain descriptions of each of the projects available in the project configuration distribution. The project tar file is also required for running the demos and tutorials included in the <I>Introducing Zebra</I> manual, or for following the tutorial available on the Zebra WWW site. (See <A HREF="install.html#REF38563">Section 13, "Whom to Contact"</A>.) Some project configurations, such as COARE, have sample sets of data files available. Sample datasets will appear as separate tar files in the Zebra FTP directory.

<H4><A NAME="REF72381">  3.3  Whether to Get Binary or Source</A></H4>
<P>There are two possible distributions: the source distribution and the binary distribution. Both distributions use the same documentation and project configurations. The source distribution contains source code, uncompiled, for all of the Zebra programs, libraries, and support files. As of version 4.2, the distribution also includes the source for the required RDSS libraries in the zebra/ui and zebra/util directories. The binary distribution contains no source files, only the compiled Zebra executables, a complete library directory, and the include directory. Essentially, the binary distribution comes "pre-built" for a specific machine architecture---the library, binary, and include directories come already installed, so the source files are not necessary.
<P>The source distribution requires more time and effort to install, since it must be configured and compiled before it can be installed and executed. However, this allows you to configure the Zebra executables as best suits your particular needs. [See <A HREF="install.html#REF82546">Section 8, "Configuring the Compilation"</A> for information about what kind of configuration options are available.] If there will be a need to do development work with Zebra, such as writing an ingest module, the source code can be a valuable place to find examples of using the Zebra library routines. If patches become available for bugs or new features, the patch can be applied directly to the Zebra source tree, and the source tree can be recompiled using your original compile configuration. Of course, the source distribution is the <I>only</I> option if you wish to port Zebra to a machine or operating system which is not presently supported.
<P>On the other hand, the binary distribution is easier to install. It does not need to be compiled, so once it is untarred Zebra is ready to execute. Binary distributions are only available for the systems currently being supported, shown in <A HREF="install.html#REF46828">Table 1 on page 6</A>.
<P><B>For HP-UX</B>, the executable binaries are statically linked to avoid requiring the installation of the MIT X libraries from the <I>InterWorks</I> CDROM. This makes for extremely large executables. Compiling the source on your local machine will create smaller, dynamically linked executables.
<P><B>For Solaris and SunOS</B>, the executable binaries are dynamically linked to Openwindows 3.0. Hence you must have OpenWindows 3.0 installed on your system in order for the executables to find the OpenWindows 3.0 shared libraries. Otherwise you need to compile and install the source distribution.

<H4><A NAME="HDR10">  3.4  Where to Put It</A></H4>
<P>Once you have a copy of the Zebra tar files, either through FTP or on tape, you have to decide where to extract them. The top of the Zebra directory tree can be located anywhere. If you untar the Zebra tar file in the directory /usr/local, the top directory of the Zebra distribution tree will be /usr/local/zebra. It is recommended that all of the directories in the Zebra distribution tree be put under the same directory. For example, if you wish the top of your Zebra tree to be in /usr/local/zebra, then /usr/local/zebra will contain the bin, lib, project, src, config, and doc directories. [See <A HREF="install.html#REF20940">Section 4, "The Zebra Directory Tree"</A>.] In other words, all of the compressed tar files listed in <A HREF="install.html#REF85314">Table 2 on page 11</A> will be extracted within the directory /usr/local. The next two sections describe how to extract the distributions.
<H4><A NAME="REF48410">  3.5  How to Extract It From Tar Files</A></H4>
<P>If you use FTP to retrieve the Zebra distribution, then you will receive compressed tar files. The files need to be uncompressed with GNU's gzip program. If this utility is not already installed on your system, the source and some binaries are available from the Zebra FTP site.
<P>To uncompress and extract the files, move to the directory in which you wish to create the zebra directory. Make sure a zebra directory does not already exist, such as from a past release, then pipe the uncompressed file into tar. If /usr/local is the chosen location for the distribution, the full sequence looks like this:
<PRE>
cd /usr/local
mv zebra zebra-4.1
gzip -dc <I>zebratargz</I> | tar xvfp -
</PRE>
<P>The argument <I>zebratargz</I> is the compressed tar file, such as /pub/zebra4.2.src.tar.gz. If the file is not in the current directory, then <I>zebratargz</I> should include the directory path to the file. This command creates a directory called zebra in the current directory (/usr/local in this example), and the distribution tree resides below the zebra directory. Following the same steps for all of the tar files will place the Zebra directories in their recommended locations. For example, extracting the project tar file in /usr/local places the project directory in /usr/local/zebra/project.

<P>Likewise, the same commands can also be used to extract the documentation tar file. The documentation can be extracted into any directory with at least a few megabytes of disk space, but again it is best to extract it into from the same directory used for the distribution and project tar files above.
<PRE>
cd <I>zebradocdir
</I>gzip -dc <I>zebradoctargz</I> | tar xvpf -
</PRE>
<P>After this command, <I>zebradocdir</I> will contain the path zebra/doc, which will in turn contain all of the Zebra documentation files.
<H4><A NAME="REF83230">  3.6  How to Extract It From Tape</A></H4>
<P>If you receive your Zebra distribution on an Exabyte tape, then you must extract the distribution from the tape onto your disk. Change to the directory in which you have decided to store the distribution. Then run the tar command:
<PRE>
tar xfpv <I>device
</PRE>
<P></I>Where <I>device</I> is the device name of the tape drive from which you will read the Zebra distribution tape.
<H3><A NAME="REF20940">  4.  The Zebra Directory Tree</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>An understanding of the Zebra directory hierarchy is worthwhile even for those installing the binary distribution, so take a moment to scan over this section before continuing with the installation.
<P><A HREF="install.html#REF94377">Figure 1</A> outlines the directory hierarchy of the Zebra source tree. Not all of the directories are shown. For example, the src directory also contains subdirectories for each of the Zebra client programs, and the ingest directory includes the source directories for many of the Zebra ingest modules.
<HR>

<P><A NAME="REF94377"> <paranum><B>FIGURE  1 </B> The Zebra directory tree.</A>
<P><A HREF="install.fig_1.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_1.gif">

<DT><B>ui</B><DD>The source for the RDSS User Interaction (UI) library. It is compiled and installed in the Zebra library directory with the other Zebra libraries.
<DT><B>util</B><DD>Source for the RDSS Util library, which also installs into the Zebra library directory.<B>
</DL></UL>
<P></B>Zebra also installs files into three directories: <B>bin</B>, <B>lib</B>, and <B>include</B>. Each of these directories either come packaged in a binary distribution, or they are created automatically during the compilation. Ordinarily the bin, lib, and include directories are placed next to the src and config directories in the top directory of the Zebra tree. The include directory holds public header files from the Zebra libraries for reference by all of the Zebra source files. 
<P>The library directory, lib, contains the library archives with which Zebra clients must link, as well as support files such as UI load files, help files, map files, and so on. The subdirectories of lib contain specialized support files:
<UL><DL>
<DT><B>resources</B><DD>X11 application defaults files.

<DT><B>colortables</B><DD>Color tables available to display manager clients such as the graphics process.
<DT><B>help</B><DD>HTML files and GIF images for on-line help topics.
</DL></UL>
<P>Zebra installs executable files into a separate binary directory, bin. The binary directory needs about 50 to 70 megabytes to hold all of the executable files, including optional programs such as ingest modules and real-time utilities. The actual size differs according to the operating system, the optional modules chosen for installation, and whether the executables are statically linked.
<P>If you are installing the binary distribution, continue with the instructions in <A HREF="install.html#REF12734">Section 5</A>. To prepare for installing the source distribution, see <A HREF="install.html#REF42176">Section 6,  "Installing the Source Distribution", on page 18.</A>

<H3><A NAME="REF42176">  6.  Installing the Source Distribution</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>There are several steps to building Zebra from the source tree. In summary, here are the steps required:

<OL>
<P><LI>Acquire required third-party software.
<BR>
<P><LI>Configure the Zebra system for your environment.
<BR>
<P><LI>Run make.
<BR></OL>


<P>The next few sections cover the above steps in detail.

<H3><A NAME="REF31635">  7.  Acquiring Third-Party Software</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>Zebra uses a few public-domain software libraries which are not included in the Zebra distribution itself. This section briefly summarizes each of those libraries and tells how to acquire each one.
<H4><A NAME="HDR13">  7.1  The RDSS Libraries</A></H4>
<P>Zebra requires the <I>most recent</I> versions of the RDSS User Interaction and RDSS Utilities libraries (RDSS libs 1.005 for Zebra v4.2). These libraries are distributed by RDP, and may be acquired by contacting one of the persons listed in <A HREF="install.html#REF38563">"Whom to Contact", Section 13 on page 43.</A> Note that Zebra does not need the RDSS Graphics library, unlike most RDP software tools. So if you do not already have the entire RDSS library package installed, and you do not need the graphics library for other RDSS software, then you can save space and time by only compiling and installing the RDSS User Interaction and Utilities libraries.
<P><B>Note:</B> The RDSS UI and Util libraries are also included in the Zebra source distribution. It is much more convenient and even recommended that Zebra be built with these directories, even if RDSS is already installed elsewhere on your system. The RDSS source in the Zebra distribution tends to be more recent and more portable, and the cost in time and space is insignificant on most systems.
<H4><A NAME="HDR14">  7.2  X11 Libraries</A></H4>
<P>Nowadays most systems include versions of the X11 libraries, either the system vendor's proprietary software or the public domain software from MIT and the X Consortium. On Sun systems, OpenWindows 3.0 contains versions of the X11 libraries which will work with the Zebra distribution. On any system, the MIT releases 4, 5, and 6 will work with Zebra. The MIT Release 5 and 6 distributions can be FTP'ed from the host ftp.x.org. 
<P><B>For HP-UX systems:</B> Use the X11 distribution from the <I>InterWorks Contributed Software Library</I>, since this distribution also includes the Athena Widgets library. (See <A HREF="install.html#REF33577">Section 7.3</A>.) The instructions for installing the X11 system from this CD are contained in the appendix, <A HREF="mach-appndx.html#REF20046">"Installation Notes for HP-UX", Section A-1 on page 47.</A>

<H4><A NAME="REF33577">  7.3  Athena Widgets</A></H4>
<P>Zebra uses a collection of user interface objects based on the X11 Toolkit called the Athena Widgets. This library is public domain and part of the standard MIT X11 release. It is included in OpenWindows 3.0 on Sun systems, and the <I>InterWorks Contributed Software Library</I> with HP-UX systems. If you have the Athena Widget library, you should be able to find a file named libXaw.a installed somewhere on the system.
<H4><A NAME="HDR15">  7.4  The netCDF Library</A></H4>
<P>NetCDF stands for the network common data form. It is an interface specification for storing and retrieving data from files. The interface was developed and then implemented by Unidata, which is managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. The Unidata implementation has the advantage of being machine-independent and widely used. The most recent version, 2.3.2, is recommended for compiling Zebra.
<P>NetCDF can be retrieved from Unidata by anonymous ftp to the host
<PRE>
unidata.ucar.edu
</PRE>
<P>or through URL
<PRE>
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/
</PRE>
<P>Once the compressed tar file has been retrieved, uncompress and untar it, and follow the installation instructions in the top directory of the distribution. Remember where the library and its include file are installed, since this information is needed to configure the Zebra compilation.
<P><B>Note:</B> if using gcc to compile the netCDF library, the Zebra distribution will need to be linked using gcc. Other C compilers will not know to provide the _builtin_saveregs symbol which gcc compiles into the netCDF library, so link commands will report an unresolved symbol error. [<A HREF="install.html#REF85127">See "Unresolved Symbols" on page 37.</A>] If you will be building Zebra with a compiler other than gcc, then compile at least one copy of the netCDF library without gcc for linking with Zebra programs.
<P><B>Note</B>: Debian <B>Linux</B> users: there is a netCDF package available as part of the standard Debian release. You may install this package rather than build the library from source if you prefer.

<H4><A NAME="REF60659">  7.5  GNU C Compiler</A></H4>
<P>Zebra is known to compile under the most recent versions of the GNU C compiler, up to 2.7.2, distributed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). If the GNU C compiler, gcc, is already installed on your system, it is strongly recommended that you use it to compile Zebra. However, the gcc compiler is not required---your system vendor's compiler will suffice. If you would like to install gcc on your system, it may be acquired via anonymous FTP from the host prep.ai.mit.edu. Note that installation of the GNU C compiler is a rather involved process and would be best left to experienced UNIX users.
<P>One of the Zebra utilities, dsmanage, requires the GNU C++ compiler, g++. See the <I>Zebra</I><I> Advanced User's Manual</I> for a description of dsmanage to determine whether it would be useful at your site. Of course, it is also possible to acquire the dsmanage utility pre-compiled from one of the Zebra binary distributions.
<H4><A NAME="HDR16">  7.6  HTML Online Help</A></H4>
<P>If you are using the World Wide Web (WWW) HTML-based online help system (highly recommended), you need to obtain the Mosaic or netscape WWW browser. Mosaic's distribution conditions do not allow us to redistribute it; however, it is available for anonymous FTP at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Netscape also has restrictive redistribution conditions, but may be obtained from ftp.netscape.com for free use by educational institutions.
<H3><A NAME="REF82546">  8.  Configuring the Compilation</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>The Zebra distribution allows many things to be configured before it is compiled, depending upon the characteristics and needs of the environment in which Zebra will be used. For example, the graphics process can be configured to include only those types of plots which will be used at a particular site. Likewise, most installations will not require ingest modules nor any of the real-time utilities, so the compilation of these parts of the Zebra system can be disabled. Some options need to be configured for all sites, such as the location of the installation directories, the location of third-party libraries and include files, the C and FORTRAN compiler commands, and special options to the compilers. This section walks through the configuration process step-by-step, particularly the details of editing the configuration file itself.

<H4><A NAME="HDR17">  8.1  Where to Install</A></H4>
<P>Before beginning the configuration process, decide where to install Zebra. Usually, the library and binary directories are located in the top-level directory of the Zebra distribution, next to the src, doc, project and config directories. This is the recommended location. Zebra files do not need to be installed in or accessible from the system-wide, public library and binary directories. In fact, keeping the Zebra files isolated simplifies incorporating future updates and running multiple versions. If disk space limitations necessitate separating the source tree and the installed directories, then Zebra can be configured accordingly with little effort. The minimum requirement is that the binary, library, and project directories be next to each other; in other words, all three directories must have the same parent directory. The parent directory will be referred to as the installation or destination directory. The Zebra start-up script, described in the <I>Introducing Zebra</I> manual, requires a single parent directory for the installation. (This is the directory assigned to the environment variable ZEB_TOPDIR.)
<H4><A NAME="HDR18">  8.2  Editing the Configuration File</A></H4>
<P>All of the compilation configuration is done by editing a single file called config.h. This file resides in
<PRE>
/zeb/config/project/config.h
</PRE>
<P>/zeb refers to the top-level directory of your distribution, depending upon where you decided to put your Zebra source tree. Most of the instructions for editing config.h are contained within the file itself. Where the configuration file and this document disagree, heed the information in the configuration file. It is naturally much easier for us to keep up to date, and practically self-documenting.
<P>Begin editing the configuration file by changing to the /zeb/config/project directory. There should be a file named config.h.dist and a file named config.h. The config.h.dist file is a copy of the original config.h file as distributed. Do not change this file. If config.h becomes corrupted, or you need to start the configuration editing from scratch---such as when installing Zebra on a different architecture---then you will be able to overwrite config.h with a fresh copy of config.h.dist. The steps shown below make sure config.h is writable and then execute a text editor on the file. In this example, the editor is vi.
<PRE>

cd /zeb/config
chmod ug+w config.h
vi config.h
</PRE>
<P>The top of the configuration file contains information about <I>how</I> to set the configuration parameters in the file. The parameters are all directives for the C pre-processor, so the lines which define configuration parameters must follow the C pre-processor syntax. Boolean parameters, which have either true or false values, are defined as either YES or NO. Other parameters require a line of text as the definition, such as the location of a third-party library. As you edit the configuration file, check the instructions and comments in the file for help with each of the definitions. The parameters being defined are themselves C pre-processor symbols, and they will be referred to as `symbols' in both the configuration file and this manual.
<P>The C pre-processor ignores all text between the character sequences `/*' and `*/'. A `/*' begins a comment, while `*/' ends it. For symbols which have multiple common definitions, such as a definition for each operating system, some of the possible definitions may be included in the configuration file as comments. To use one of the commented definitions rather than the original, first insert the original into a comment: prefix the line with `/*' and append `*/'. Then delete the `/*' and `*/' from the definition you wish to use. To leave a symbol undefined, force the C pre-processor to ignore the definition by turning the entire definition line into a comment.
<P>Some symbol definitions are ignored if a certain condition is not met, such as a particular system architecture symbol has not been defined. For example, the following definition is ignored for all systems except HPUX:
<PRE>
#ifdef HPArchitecture /* HP-UX */
# define FortranLibraries -lU77 -lf -lisamstub
#endif
</PRE>
<P>If you are configuring for an HP, these lines will automatically define the FORTRAN libraries for you. On all other systems these lines have no effect and should be ignored.

<P>The following sections list each symbol from config.h in the left margin, next to the paragraphs which discuss how to appropriately define that particular symbol. Refer to the margin if you need to find a symbol quickly and double-check its meaning while editing the configuration file.
<H4><A NAME="REF60690">  8.3  Specifying a Help Browser</A></H4>
<P>The variable UseMosaic must be set to indicate whether the online help system will use an HTML help browser by default. If set to YES (the default), you will need to be sure that you have the Mosaic browser (executable named "Mosaic") on your system and in the users' PATH variable. If you wish to use netscape as your help browser instead, uncomment the definition of MOSAIC_COMMAND and change its value to "netscape". The MOSAIC_COMMAND symbol can also be used to specify an absolute path for the Web browser, if necessary. However, the command must include the string `netscape' if Zebra should use the netscape remote control mechanism. Otherwise Zebra will use the Mosaic remote control interface.
<H4><A NAME="HDR19">  8.4  Specifying Important Directory Paths</A></H4>
<P><CODE></CODE>Next, specify directory paths for the Zebra installation.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_43.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_43.gif">
</A>
<UL><DL>
<DT>BaseDir<DD>The top directory of the Zebra distirbution.
<DT>BinDir<DD>The directory in which to install binary files.
<DT>LibDir<DD>The directory in which to install library files.
</DL></UL>
<P>Make sure the base Zebra directory has enough available disk space for the installed library and binary files. We recommend installing the binary and library directories in the top-level directory of the source tree, in which case only the BaseDir symbol needs to be edited. The library and binary directories default to being subdirectories of BaseDir. The DataDir symbol present in past releases is now obsolete and no longer needs to be set.
<H4><A NAME="HDR20">  8.5  Choosing Which Parts of Zebra to Compile</A></H4>

<P><CODE></CODE>The BuildRDSS symbol can be used to build the RDSS UI and Util libraries <I>if and only if</I> they have been included with the Zebra distribution. Often the RDSS libraries are installed separately, so this symbol can be left as NO unless the top level of your Zebra distribution tree contains the ui and util directories. Changing the BuildRDSS definition to YES tells the top-level Makefile to build and install the ui and util directories before building the rest of the Zebra distribution. In some places in the config.h file, other symbol definitions are hidden inside conditionals based upon whether BuildRDSS has been set to YES. These conditionals are necessary and should not be removed. If BuildRDSS is true, the rest of the definitions for locations of RDSS libraries and files should be ignored. Even if RDSS has been installed elsewhere on your system, it is likely more convenient to compile the RDSS library source supplied with the Zebra release. This source is current and more recently verified to be portable among the supported architectures.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_19.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_19.gif">
</A>
<P><CODE></CODE>If BuildRDSS is NO, then the location of the installed RDSS tree should be defined in RDSSDir. The default path is /rdss.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_61.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_61.gif">
</A>
<P><CODE></CODE>As mentioned in <A HREF="install.html#REF60690">Section 8.3</A>, Zebra has a few options for its help interface. The original help application, xhelp, is still included in the distribution and can be installed for use by older project configurations, such as the StormFEST CD-ROMs. However, most sites will want to ignore xhelp and begin using the much friendlier Web help interface. Define the BuildXHelp symbol to NO to completely avoid building and installing the xhelp application. This can save time and space in the installation. If BuildXHelp is NO, then the help browser will automatically default to Mosaic. If BuildXHelp is YES, then unless UseMosaic is YES the default browser will be xhelp. As long as xhelp is installed, the display manager can choose between the xhelp and Web interfaces at run-time. Beginning with version 4.2, the BuildXHelp symbol defaults to NO. The next release of Zebra will not include xhelp.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_33.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_33.gif">
</A>
<P><CODE></CODE>The next section of config.h specifies the ingest programs to build during compilation. These programs are not likely to ever be needed except for sites which are running Zebra in real-time. If down the road you discover a need for a particular ingest module, it is easier to compile that module individually at that time. For now, avoid compiling all of the ingest modules by leaving this line unchanged.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_59.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_59.gif">
</A>
<PRE>
#define BuildIngest NO
</PRE>
<P>For information on individual ingest modules, and instructions for building them, see the <I>Data Management Guide</I>. In most cases the only documentation for an ingest program is a usage message and the code itself. If you think you need a particular ingest program, be prepared to wrestle with it a little bit to get it to meet your application. Or, feel free to request assistance from one of the persons listed in <A HREF="install.html#REF38563">Section 13,  "Whom to Contact", on page 43.</A>

<P><CODE></CODE>The symbol BuildRealtimeDataStoreTools controls the compilation of the realtime clients Archiver, LastData, and NetXfr. It is rare that a site needs these tools, so this symbol should be set to NO unless you explicitly know you need one or more of them. Information on any of these tools can be found in the <I>Guide to Realtime Zebra</I>.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_37.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_37.gif">
</A>
<P><CODE></CODE>The definition of BuildDataManager controls the compilation of two utilities for handling archived data, dsmanage and tapeindex. These utilities can be extremely useful for many sites, especially those sites which are limited in local disk space for data; however, they are not absolutely necessary. Both programs require the GNU C++ compiler, g++, versions 2.7.0 and higher. Unless you have installed the correct version of this compiler, define BuildDataManager to NO. If you define it to YES, you may need to specify the C++ compiler further forward in the config.h file (see <A HREF="install.html#REF86228">"Specifying a C++ Compiler" on page 28</A>). As an alternative to compiling dsmanage and tapeindex yourself, they can be acquired from a Zebra binary distribution.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_39.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_39.gif">
</A>
<P><CODE></CODE>The source for several data file utilities resides in /zeb/src/datautil. This directory houses a set of tools for handling various file formats and converting the files into Zebra-readable netCDF files. For example, the two utilities gprotocdf and mudtocdf convert GENPRO and MUDRAS files into netCDF. Define the symbol BuildDataUtilities to YES if you wish to compile the utilities during this compilation. Otherwise, if the symbol is set to NO, the programs can be compiled individually as needed. <B>SGI users note</B> that when last tested, problems remained in building the data utilities under IRIX; in particular, mudtocdf does not successfully build. Details on the data utilities can be found in the <I>Data Management Guide</I>.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_41.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_41.gif">
</A>
<H4><A NAME="HDR21">  8.6  Configuring the Compiler Commands</A></H4>

<P>At this point in the configuration file, you have finished choosing which parts of the Zebra source tree will be built during the installation process. Next comes the configuration of the compiler commands. Various directory paths to libraries and include files must be specified, along with the C and FORTRAN compiler commands and any special options to those commands. The configuration file tries to do as much of the work for you as possible. If all of your X11 libraries are in one directory, you only need to specify that one directory, and the make process will generate the correct compiler options for each library. Likewise, if all of the necessary include files, such as netcdf.h, reside in a standard directory which is automatically searched by the compiler, such as /usr/include, then you do not need to explicitly define any include directory paths. If you are using GNU C, then /usr/local/include is also searched automatically.
<P><CODE></CODE>If you will be using OpenWindows 3.0 on Sun systems, verify that the definitions of UseOpenWindows and OpenWindowsVersion in config.h match the definitions below:
<P><A HREF="install.fig_23.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_23.gif">
</A>
<PRE>
#define UseOpenWindows               YES
#define OpenWindowsVersion                           3
</PRE>
<P>If OpenWindows does not reside in the usual location of /usr/openwin, then specify the OpenWindows home directory in the symbol OpenWinHome. For example,
<PRE>
#define OpenWinHome              /local/openwin
</PRE>
<P>The OpenWindows X11 libraries follow the X11 standard, so even if linked with the OpenWindows X11 libraries, Zebra will still run under a non-OpenWindows server and a non-OpenLook window manager. Likewise, if linked with the MIT X11 libraries, Zebra will run under the OpenWindows server and the OpenLook window manager. If you have MIT X11 Release 4 or greater installed on your system, and even though you wish to run Zebra under OpenWindows, it is recommended that you first try to compile with the MIT libraries, since this will not prevent you from using Zebra under the OpenWindows server.
<P><B>Note</B>: It is important that the RDSS libraries and the Zebra programs are compiled with the same set of X11 include files and linked with the same X11 libraries. Do not mix different X11 implementations, such as compiling RDSS with a vendor implementation and then linking Zebra with the MIT implementation. If the RDSS libraries which you will be linking with were compiled with the MIT X11 libraries, then Zebra <I>must also be compiled</I> with the MIT X11 libraries. Likewise, if the RDSS libraries were compiled with OpenWindows, then Zebra must be compiled with OpenWindows also. [If the RDSS libraries and Zebra are being built from the same tree by defining BuildRDSS to YES, then the RDSS libraries will automatically be compiled with the same X11 as the rest of Zebra.]
<P><B>Note for SunOS</B>: There is a bug in the OpenWindows 3.0 Xmu library which causes unresolved symbols when dynamically linking with Zebra programs. This bug should be patched according to the instructions given in <A HREF="mach-appndx.html#REF56435">Appendix A-2.1,  "OpenWindows 3.0 Patches", on page 49.</A>

<P>Zebra's graphics performance can be improved by using the X11 Shared Memory Extension. This extension to the X11 protocol allows graphics to be exchanged between the client and server through shared memory, provided both client and server are running on the same host. Most servers support this extension, including all servers running on the architectures supported by Zebra. To determine whether your server supports the extension, run xdpyinfo and look for a line in the output containing MIT-SHM; the presence of this line indicates that the server supports the shared memory extension. If your server <I>and your kernel</I> support shared memory, leave XSharedMemory defined to YES, otherwise define it as NO. See <A HREF="install.html#REF70619">Section 12.2 on page 41</A> for information on enabling shared memory in your system kernel.
<P><CODE></CODE>If you already have the GNU C compiler, gcc, installed on your system, it is recommended that you use it to compile Zebra. Information about how and whether to try to acquire gcc is given in <A HREF="install.html#REF60659">Section 7.5 on page 21</A>. If you wish to use gcc, then make sure the gcc command is in your path and define UseGcc to YES in config.h.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_27.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_27.gif">
</A>
<PRE>
#define UseGcc YES
</PRE>
<P>This definition will automatically set up the correct compiler command and any related options. It will also automatically choose the GNU C++ compiler, g++, for compiling dsmanage if BuildDataManager was defined to YES and if CplusplusCmd is left undefined.
<P><B>Note for HP-UX</B>: Either GNU C or the HP-UX cc compiler will work. However, recent versions of gcc distributed by the FSF do not support debugging under HP-UX. Therefore, to use the GNU C compiler for Zebra under HP-UX, either turn off the debugging flag -g (see CDebugFlags below), or install the special version of gcc available from the host jaguar.cs.utah.edu.
<P><B>Note for IRIX:</B> It is possible to compile Zebra using gcc-2.6.1 and IRIX 5.2. Severe problems have been experienced with earlier versions of both the compiler and the operating system; if you cannot upgrade to the above versions use of the vendor's C compiler is recommended. If you use gcc, it is recommend that you also install the GNU binutils 2.5 or later and configure gcc to use the GNU assembler (gas). Otherwise debugging support will not be present.

<P>The dsmanage and tapeindex utilities, in the directory /zeb/src/dsmanage, are written in C++, so they require a C++ compiler. If you do not have a C++ compiler, then you should have defined BuildDataManager to NO (see above, <A HREF="install.html#REF0">page 26</A>). At the moment, dsmanage is only known to compile with the GNU C++ compiler. The Sun C++ compiler, CC, will not work.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_21.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_21.gif">
</A>
<P>If you want to use the GNU C++ compiler, g++, which comes with the GNU C compiler distribution, and UseGcc is defined to be YES, then the configuration will automatically try to use g++. Make sure g++ is in your path.
<P>If UseGcc is defined to NO, the C++ compiler defaults to CC. To specify a different compiler, define the symbol CplusplusCmd, as in the example line below.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_35.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_35.gif">
</A>
<PRE>
#define CplusplusCmd            /tools/bin/cplus

<P>If UseGcc is YES, then the g++ compiler will be selected automatically and the Cplusplus defintions can be ignored.
<P>Special options to the C++ compiler can be defined in the symbol CplusplusOptions, such as specific class libraries or include paths. All of the regular C compiler options will automatically be added to the C++ command line, so CplusplusOptions defaults to an empty definition.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_47.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_47.gif">
</A>
<P>The C and FORTRAN compiler configurations use a similar set of symbols to separately define the compiler command, debugging options, and other flags such as optimization. For the C compiler, the symbols are CCompiler, CDebugFlags, and CCOptions. Usually, CCompiler does not need to be defined, in which case a system default is used, or if UseGCC has been defined to YES, then the compiler gcc is used. CDebugFlags can usually be left as `g'. This option tells the compiler to include debugging information in the executables. When running a new Zebra installation, this information can be valuable if a process dumps core unexpectedly. Later, after Zebra proves to operate reliably, the system can be recompiled without the debugging option, or the executables can be `stripped' (see strip(1)) to save space. The CCOptions symbol usually contains only optimization options. Most compilers cannot optimize code being compiled with debugging information, so usually one of the two symbols CDebugFlags and CCOptions is empty. A notable exception to this rule is the GNU C compiler, which will accept both the `g' and `O' flags, allowing debugging information in code which has been optimized.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_49.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_49.gif">
</A>

<P><B>Note for HP-UX</B>: The HP native compiler cannot compile the map projection library ("Proj") header file without the ANSI option, -Aa. The CCOptions symbols includes -Aa for HP-UX by default; however, if you are compiling with the Proj library and defining CCOptions yourself, be sure to include the -Aa option.
<P>The Zebra graphics process (gp) and some of the ingest modules and data utilities require a FORTRAN 77 compiler. The symbol FortranCompiler defines the compiler command. If this symbol has no definition, then a default will be supplied by make(1) for your particular system, usually f77. A debugging flag for the FORTRAN compiler, such as `g', can be defined in the symbol FortDebugFlags. Ordinarily it is a good idea to leave this symbol's definition empty, since most compilers will disable optimization when passed a debugging flag, and debugging information in the FORTRAN object code is not very useful with Zebra. You will benefit much more from the optimization. In the graphics process, FORTRAN code supplies all of the gridding and objective analysis capability, so optimizing this code produces greater benefits than including debugging information in the executable file. The optimization flag, usually `-O', and other FORTRAN compiler options should be specified in the FortOptions definition.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_45.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_45.gif">
</A>
<P><B>For HP-UX systems</B>: HP Fortran requires the +ppu option. The defaults in config.h are now set up to select this option automatically on HP systems. If you explicitly define a value for FortOptions, include the +ppu option.
<P>This example selects the GNU FORTRAN compiler, g77:
<PRE>
#define FortranCompiler g77
</PRE>
<P>If you are building under <B>Linux</B>, use of g77 is required (i.e. f2c does not work).

<P>Next, the configuration file defines the locations of necessary header files in the symbols XIncDir, NetCDFIncDir, and RDSSIncDir. Each symbol specifies the include directory of a particular header file, as indicated by the symbol's name. XIncDir tells where to find all of the X11 header files: this is the include directory which contains a subdirectory called X11, in which all of the X11 header files actually reside. Likewise, NetCDFIncDir is the directory which contains the netCDF header file netcdf.h, and RDSSIncDir is the directory into which RDSS library header files were installed. If the required header files can be found in a standard include directory, such as /usr/include, then leave the corresponding symbol undefined. Otherwise, define the symbol to the absolute path of the directory which contains the needed header files. For example,

</A>
<PRE>
#define NetCDFIncDir /local/unidata/include
</PRE>
<P>The actual option to the compiler, `I/local/unidata/include', will be generated automatically.
<P><B>For Sun systems</B>, remember to set the X include directory to correspond with your choice for X libraries. If you set UseOpenWindows to YES above, then leave XIncDir undefined so that the default of OpenWinHome/include will be used for the X include path.
<P>Zebra can be built with an interface to HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) satellite files generated by SeaSpace's TDF-to-HDF converter.  TDF is the Terascan data format used by SeaSpace.  HDF comes from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.  Zebra's HDF access is limited to SeaSpace satellite images and will not yet work with general Raster, Palette, or SDS data objects.  If you need to read other HDF files, let us know so that we have an idea of the demand and the types of access needed.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_25.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_25.gif">
</A>
<P>Source code and documentation for HDF are available via anonymous ftp at this URL:
<PRE>
ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF
</PRE>
<P>Some general information on HDF, including a FAQ, is available here: 
<PRE>
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/HDF/HDFIntro.html
</PRE>
<P>The Zebra interface has only been tested with HDF 3.3r2.
<P>If you do not have HDF, leave HasHDF as its default of NO.  Usually only those working with Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) project data will need HDF support.  If you have HDF and HDF satellite images you would like to display, define HasHDF to YES.  HDFIncDir should be the path to the HDF header files, and HDFLibDir is the directory of the HDF library.  Or you can define HDFLibrary to the full path, including the file name, of the HDF library:
<PRE>
#define HDFLibrary /usr/local/ncsa/libdf.a

</PRE>
<P><B>LINUX</B>: At present, the earliest HDF version claimed to be ported to Linux is 4.0 beta. However, Zebra has never been tested with this version and is not even known to successfully build with it.
<P>Lastly, the configuration file defines the names and locations of several libraries. If a library has its conventional name and is located in one of the library directories which the compiler automatically searches, then that library's symbol can be left undefined. If only the library's location---and not its name---is unusual, then the library's directory can be defined in the appropriate symbol, either XLibDir, NetCDFLibDir, or RDSSLibDir. As with the include directory symbols, these symbols should only contain an absolute path to the directory which contains the required library. For example,
<P><A HREF="install.fig_55.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_55.gif">
</A>
<PRE>
#define XLibDir /local/X11R5/lib
</PRE>
<P>The configuration files automatically generate the L/local/X11R5/lib option and pass it to the compiler.
<P><B>For Solaris</B>, when XLibDir is defined, a R option is passed to the linker specifying the run-time library directory in which to find the X libraries. This option overrides the LD_RUN_PATH environment variable, which serves the same purpose as the -R linker option.
<P>If you need to specify the actual names of the libraries or library-related compiler options, then you must define the compiler options in the symbols XLibraries, NetCDFLibrary, and RDSSLibrary. Some examples follow, though for almost all sites these symbols can be left undefined. If one of these symbols has a definition, then that definition overrides the corresponding XLibDir, NetCDFLibDir, or RDSSLibDir symbol.
<P><A HREF="install.fig_51.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_51.gif">
</A>
<PRE>
#define NetCDFLibrary /local/src/netcdf/libnetcdf.a
#define XLibraries -L/X11R5/contrib/lib -lXaw \
  -L/X11R5 -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11
#define RDSSLibrary -Bstatic /rdss2/librdssui.a \
  /rdss2/librdssutil.a -Bdynamic
</PRE>
<P>The second line handles a case where the Athena Widget library is not in the same directory as the standard X11 libraries. The third definition imbeds options to the linker in the list of library archives.
<P>The Debian <B>Linux</B> netcdf package puts the netCDF library in /usr/lib/netcdf.

<P>The Zebra distribution uses the C compiler to link programs which contain both compiled FORTRAN code and compiled C code. Consequently, the C compiler must be told which FORTRAN libraries the FORTRAN code requires. The symbol FortranLibraries contains the linker options which find and link these libraries. The configuration file contains several examples of this symbol's definition. These definitions may have to be modified slightly for your particular system, especially if your FORTRAN compiler or libraries were not installed in their conventional location on your system. Under Solaris, the Fortran libraries will usually be found in a place like /opt/SUNWspro/lib. You can probably just uncomment the definition for your particular system and make sure that the other definitions are commented. If you are using SunOS 4.1.x and a version of SPARCompilers greater than SC1.0.1, see <A HREF="mach-appndx.html#REF42048">Appendix A-2.2,  "Compiling with SPARCompilers Version SC2.0.1", on page 50.</A>
<P><A HREF="install.fig_57.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_57.gif">
</A>
<P>A series of ifdef macros in the config.h file attempt to determine the correct value for the FortranLibraries symbol automatically. To override any of the automatic choices, define FortranLibraries <I>before</I> this line:
<PRE>
#ifndef FortranLibraries
</PRE>
<P>Otherwise, find the section for your particular architecture and verify that FortranLibraries is set correctly.
<H4><A NAME="HDR22">  8.7  Map Projections</A></H4>
<P>The graphics process can perform map projections using the proj library from the U.S. Geological Survey. The library requires a C compiler which supports ANSI prototypes, such as gcc. Many native compilers can compile the library, though some may require special options. It can be obtained from the ATD FTP site or from kai.er.usgs.gov. Thanks to Gerald Evenden of the USGS for allowing us to use and redistribute this library. To enable projections, set MapProjections to YES. The ProjLibDir and ProjIncDir symbols should be defined to the location of the library and its include file, respectively. If necessary, the specific compiler options can be specified with the ProjLibrary and ProjIncludes symbols.
<H4><A NAME="HDR23">  8.8  Selecting Plot Types and Overlays</A></H4>

<P><CODE></CODE>If so desired, you may select the types of plots which will be needed for this installation of Zebra. By default, all of them will be compiled into the Zebra graphics process and available for use; only rarely will the default set-up be inadequate. If you have no reason to limit the plots made by Zebra, then go to section, <A HREF="install.html#REF23180">Chapter 8.10, "Saving the Configuration File."</A> 
<P><A HREF="install.fig_29.ps"><IMG SRC="install.fig_29.gif">
</A>
<P>Skip the section of the config.h file covering customization of the distribution, and find the section on "Selecting Graphics Process Plot Types". In general, the defaults for all of these settings will always suffice. If a particular plot type will never be needed at your site, then disabling the plot type before compilation will reduce the size of the graphics process's executable file. However, leaving a plot type enabled will not be debilitating to your system either. To disable a plot type, define its corresponding symbol to NO. For example, this line disables cross sections:
<PRE>
#define C_PT_XSECT       NO
</PRE>
<P>Constant-altitude plots have a second division of plotting capability called representation, which essentially refers to the method of drawing particular classes of data. For example, if you know you will never be drawing lightning data in a constant-altitude plot, you can define C_CAP_LIGHTNING to NO. Again, it is hardly necessary to disable a plot representation just because it is not likely that it will ever be used.

<H4><A NAME="HDR24">  8.9  Advanced Configuration Parameters</A></H4>
<P>The configuration file also contains some advanced parameters which can be used to customize the configuration for specific projects or special distributions. Most installation sites can ignore these parameters and skip to the next section. For those few sites which want to create a customized distribution, or which know that some of the default string and array length limits do not suffice for their applications, see the <I>Zebra Developer's Guide</I>.
<H4><A NAME="REF23180">  8.10  Saving the Configuration File</A></H4>
<P>You have now finished editing the configuration file. Save the file to disk and exit from the editor. Then continue with the instructions for compiling Zebra in the next section. If at a later time you wish to start editing the config.h file from scratch, you can overwrite config.h with the file config.h.dist.

<H3><A NAME="REF18004">  9.  Compiling Zebra</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>Once the config.h file has been edited for your particular site, you are ready to compile and install Zebra. From this point, all of the work will be performed by the make program with Makefiles configured by the definitions in config.h.
<H4><A NAME="HDR25">  9.1  The Imake System</A></H4>
<P>The Zebra distribution uses the Imake system, developed by the X Consortium for its X11 Window System distribution. Essentially, Imake detects machine-specific definitions in the C pre-processor and uses the C pre-processor to generate Makefiles from more portable and more flexible files called Imakefiles. Imake also takes care of setting include and library paths in each Makefile, even those paths which are relative to the top directory of the distribution tree. A central file (in this case /zeb/config/project/Zebra.rules) defines rules for Zebra Makefile targets, so the rules can be adjusted as needs change and to support new machines. For detailed information about Zebra's use of Imake, see the <I>Zebra Developer's Guide</I>.
<H4><A NAME="HDR26">  9.2  The Make Command</A></H4>
<P>The Zebra make process is broken into several steps. First, the imake program must be compiled. Then, imake generates a top-level Makefile from the top-level Imakefile. Next, imake generates Makefiles for each of the subdirectories in the Zebra distribution. Once the Makefiles exist, the make process performs the usual targets in each subdirectory: cleaning, installing include files, generating include file dependencies, and finally compiling and installing the libraries and programs. These targets are named clean, includes, depend, and finally install, respectively.
<P>All of these steps are performed automatically by the top-level Makefile target <I>World</I>. You may use either your system's standard make command, or you may use the GNU make command. The make process will use whichever make command appears first in your path. First, change to the top directory of the Zebra source tree. Make sure the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is not set, unless you intentionally set it to specify library paths for the Zebra build. Otherwise, the linker may link with the wrong set of X libraries, especially if you have OpenWindows on the system. 
<PRE>
unsetenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH

</PRE>
<P>Then, for all systems except Solaris, run the following command:
<PRE>
make World &gt;&amp; make.zebra &amp;
</PRE>
<P><B>For Solaris</B>, the C pre-processor does not pre-define a unique symbol for distinguishing Solaris systems, so the symbol must be supplied on the make command line as follows.
<PRE>
make World BOOSTRAPCFLAGS=-Dsolaris &gt;&amp; make.zebra &amp;
</PRE>
<P>You can also specify the bootstrap flag used by the X11R6 distribution for Solaris:
<PRE>
make World BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS=-DSVR4 &gt;&amp; make.zebra &amp;
</PRE>
<P>By default, the imake program is compiled with the system's default C compiler, since the Makefiles have not yet been generated to use the C compiler defined in config.h. Ordinarily, this is not a problem. However, if make cannot find the default C compiler command, then you must specify the compiler command on the make command line. For example,
<PRE>
make World CC=/usr/gnu/bin/gcc &gt;&amp; make.zebra &amp;
</PRE>
<P>The output of the make command is redirected to the make.zebra file so that any errors during the compilation will be recorded for later investigation. You can monitor the log file as the build progresses with this command:
<PRE>
tail -f make.zebra
</PRE>
<P>This command simply echoes to the terminal all text written to the log file. You can interrupt the log file listing at any time, without halting the build itself, by typing Control-C. Once the build stops, either with an error message or the message "Zebra build complete", the tail command must be halted with Control-C to get back the shell prompt.
<P>If the top-level Makefile becomes corrupted or gets erased, the make commands above will abort with an error message. To restore a workable Makefile, copy the backup file Makefile.bak into Makefile.
<PRE>
cp Makefile.bak Makefile

</PRE>
<P>Then you can try the make command again. If all else fails, overwrite the top-level Makefile with the file Makefile.ini and start from the beginning.
<PRE>
cp Makefile.ini Makefile
</PRE>
<H4><A NAME="REF26371">  9.3  Checking for Errors</A></H4>
<P>The compilation will take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending upon your machine and the options chosen in the configuration file. Once the compilation is done, inspect the log file make.zebra for any errors which occurred during the build. There may be a few to several non-fatal compiler warnings, such as in the ui and dsmanage directories, and in the files ScrolledList.c and MultiList.c; these can be safely ignored. If there are no other error messages, then Zebra compiled and installed correctly. Otherwise, see <A HREF="install.html#REF44395">Section 10, "In Case of Errors"</A>, for troubleshooting help. Once you have successfully resolved any errors, you may want to make some adjustments to the operating system. These adjustments are described in <A HREF="install.html#REF65572">Section 12, "Tuning the Operating System"</A>.
<P><B>Note for Solaris</B>: Unfortunately, one of the Solaris 2.4 system header files blatantly includes sys/feature_tests.h more than once. The makedepend program will announce this fact a few dozen times over while it generates dependencies. All of those warnings about feature_tests.h can be ignored.
<H3><A NAME="REF44395">  10.  In Case of Errors</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>Most compilation errors will be correctable by editing the config.h file and recompiling. First, make whatever changes appear necessary to config.h, according to the error messages received and the suggestions below. Next, attempt the build again as described in <A HREF="install.html#REF15502">Section 10.5,  "Re-compiling After Errors", on page 40.</A> The rest of this section lists common pitfalls and probable solutions. Also, the appendix of machine-specific notes may be helpful also.
<H4><A NAME="REF85127">  10.1  Unresolved Symbols</A></H4>

<P>If a program cannot be properly linked because of missing symbols, try to determine in which library the symbols should be found. Either the compiler could not find the library or the library archive is corrupted. Verify that the location of the library was specified correctly in config.h. For example, if the unresolved symbols are from the netCDF library, then the location of the netCDF library has not been correctly specified in config.h. If the error message suggests that a library archive's table of contents, or symbol table, is missing or outdated, then rebuild the symbol table with the ranlib(1) command.
<P>If the XSharedMemory symbol in config.h is defined to YES, but your X libraries do not contain the shared memory extension, then the _XShmQueryVersion symbol will not be found. To correct this problem, define XSharedMemory to NO in config.h and recompile.
<P>If the unresolved symbols do not look familiar, and if they contain 7 or fewer letters and perhaps a trailing underscore (`_'), it is probable that a necessary FORTRAN library has been left out of the FortranLibraries symbol in config.h. Check your FORTRAN compiler's documentation to find out what libraries are required when linking C and FORTRAN code with a C compiler.
<P><B>For HP-UX</B>, the unresolved symbols may look like FORTRAN symbols without a trailing underscore. For example, the graphics process, in directory zeb/src/gp, may leave the symbols bints and do_rgrid unresolved. If this is the case, it means the +ppu option is missing from the FortOptions definition in config.h. See <A HREF="mach-appndx.html#REF70510">Appendix A-1.2,  "HP-UX FORTRAN Compiler Options", on page 48.</A>
<P><B>For OpenWindows 3.0</B>, if the unresolved symbols are
<PRE>
get_wmShellWidgetClass
</PRE>
<P>and
<PRE>
get_applicationShellWidgetClass,
</PRE>
<P>then a patch needs to be applied to your OpenWindows Xmu library. See <A HREF="mach-appndx.html#REF56435">Appendix A-2.1,  "OpenWindows 3.0 Patches", on page 49.</A>
<P>If the symbol _builtin_saveregs is unresolved, it likely means that you are using cc to link with a library compiled with gcc. In particular, if the netCDF library is compiled with gcc, it must be linked by gcc or else re-compiled with cc. Other libraries, such as the MIT X11 libraries, should not have this problem.

<P><B>For Sun systems</B>, if you see messages about undefined symbols _XtStrings and _XtShellStrings, then you are trying to link with RDSS libraries which were compiled for different X libraries than those with which you are linking Zebra. More than likely, the RDSS libraries were compiled with MIT X11 libraries, while Zebra is trying to compile and link with OpenWindows include files and libraries. To correct this problem, either re-compile the RDSS libraries to use the X11 libraries you are using for Zebra, or change the appropriate symbols UseOpenWindows, XIncDir, XLibDir, and XLibraries in config.h. Then re-compile Zebra using the instructions in <A HREF="install.html#REF15502">Section 10.5</A>.
<P><B>With Sun C 3.0</B>, if you see routines like __atanf come up undefined, make sure that -lsunmath is in the list of Fortran libraries.
<P><B>On SGI systems</B>, mudtocdf (part of the data utilities) does not build due to unresolved symbols resulting from a disagreement about certain Fortran intrinsic functions.
<H4><A NAME="HDR27">  10.2  Runtime Dynamic Linking Errors</A></H4>
<P>If you are building under <B>Solaris</B> using MIT X, and your X libraries are not in /usr/lib, then the Imake configuration should automatically include a R <I>runpath</I> link option on the compiler command line. The -R option causes the given <I>runpath</I> to be inserted into the binaries you build, avoiding a whole series of "library not found" problems when programs are executed later. If you see such errors, the R option is not being passed or is being specified incorrectly. If the R flag is not present on the command line, then the environment variable LD_RUN_PATH takes effect. If necessary, you can explicitly set LD_RUN_PATH to point to the directory containing the X11 libraries, but R takes precedence when present.
<H4><A NAME="HDR28">  10.3  Missing Header Files</A></H4>
<P>If a header file cannot be found by the compiler or the makedepend program, then most likely an include path was incorrectly specified in config.h. Check the include path definition in config.h and verify that the missing header file is in the specified include directory.
<H4><A NAME="HDR29">  10.4  Corrupted Makefile in /zeb/config/imake</A></H4>

<P>Sometimes putting improper or illegal compiler options in config.h will cause the Makefiles to be corrupted and makes to fail. This can be especially bothersome if it prevents imake from re-compiling, since Makefiles cannot be re-generated correctly without imake. If the Makefile in the /zeb/config/imake directory is causing problems, overwrite it with the bootstrap Makefile.ini as follows.
<PRE>
% cd /zeb/config/imake
% cp Makefile.ini Makefile
</PRE>
<P>Then you can restart the compilation.
<H4><A NAME="REF15502">  10.5  Re-compiling After Errors</A></H4>
<P>You must recompile Zebra from the top of the hierarchy after making changes to the configuration or to third-party software installations. Make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH is still not set. Then, for all systems except solaris, run
<PRE>
make World &gt;&gt;&amp; make.zebra &amp;
</PRE>
<P>And for <B>Solaris</B> systems, run
<PRE>
make BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS=-Dsolaris World &gt;&gt;&amp; make.zebra &amp;
</PRE>
<P>This command will re-build imake, re-build all of the Makefiles, clean the distribution, re-install all of the include files, and re-compile and install the distribution. These are the same commands used for the initial compilation.
<P>Note that the output of the make command above is appended to the original log file using `&gt;&gt;&amp;'. This avoids overwriting the original error messages, which may be useful if the first attempts at fixes do not succeed. You could also decide to use a different log file name for each compilation attempt. Either way, if somewhere down the line you need assistance getting Zebra to build, it is helpful to have log information from all of the build attempts.
<P>Once the re-compilation is finished, the last few installation steps should be repeated beginning with <A HREF="install.html#REF26371">Section 9.3,  "Checking for Errors", on page 37.</A>
<H3><A NAME="HDR30">  11.  After a Successful Installation</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>Finally, you can now move on to learning how to run and use Zebra. The <I>Introducing Zebra</I> guide contains the basics, as well as useful pointers to other manuals and documentation.

<P>To clean up the source distribution and save disk space, you can remove all of the object files, libraries, and executables generated during the compilation with the `clean' make target.
<PRE>
% cd /zeb
% make clean
</PRE>
<P>From the top level, this target traverses the entire source tree executing the `clean' target in each directory. Within each directory, the `clean' target removes the object files, library archives, or programs generated specifically within that directory. This does not clean the installed directories: lib, bin, and include. Those directories are necessary for running Zebra and for compiling Zebra programs.
<P>The <I>Developer's Guide</I> mentions other make targets for greater flexibility and control of the build process and the source tree.
<H3><A NAME="REF65572">  12.  Tuning the Operating System</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>A few system changes can be made to help Zebra and the operating system cooperate more efficiently and effectively. These changes are optional, but recommended.
<H4><A NAME="HDR31">  12.1  Setting the Message Handler Port</A></H4>
<P>The Zebra message handler expects a message port to exist on its local system. If this port does not exist, the message handler prints a warning to the terminal and uses a default port. This is not a problem, but it does slow the message handler's start-up. To create the message port, the super user must put the following line in the /etc/services file:
<PRE>
zeb-msg      3343/tcp      # Zebra msg handler
</PRE>
<P>There is nothing special about 3343; chose another number if 3343 conflicts with an existing services entry. The message handler only uses this port to open network connections to other Zebra sessions, so it is not important unless you will be interconnecting Zebra sessions.
<H4><A NAME="REF70619">  12.2  Enabling Shared Memory</A></H4>

<P>As of version 4.0, Zebra does not use any of the System V Interprocess Communication (IPC) facilities (shared memory and semaphores) in the DataStore. However, the graphics process still tries to improve performance by using the X Shared Memory Extension whenever possible. This section gives instructions for making sure that shared memory is enabled in the kernel on your system. If your system cannot support shared memory, or you do not wish to modify the kernel, then XSharedMemory should have been defined to NO when you configured the Zebra compilation.
<P><B>SunOS 4.1.x:
<P></B>Refer to the chapter entitled <I>Reconfiguring the System Kernel </I>of the <I>Sun System Network and Administration Manual</I>. The chapter describes how to edit the kernel configuration file, then how to compile and install a new kernel. Follow the instructions for editing the configuration file, then find the IPC options, IPCMESSAGE, IPCSEMAPHORE, and IPCSHMEM, in the file.
<PRE>
options IPCMESSAGE # System V IPC message facility
options IPCSEMAPHORE # System V IPC semaphore facility
options IPCSHMEM # System V IPC shared-memory facility
</PRE>
<P>Make sure all of these lines are enabled by removing any `#' characters at the beginning of the line. Characters following `#' on a line are ignored by the configure program.
<P>The default limit on shared memory segment sizes is 1024 kilobytes, which is too small to be useful for graphics. Increase this limit by adding a line like the following:
<PRE>
options SHMSIZE=4096
</PRE>
<P>Save the kernel configuration file with the changes, and continue with the instructions in the manual for compiling and installing the new kernel.
<P><B>Solaris 2.x:
<P></B>Solaris 2 supports shared memory by default, and no action should be required on your part to make use of it. However, in some situations, you may find that the default limits on shared memory are insufficient for Zebra's needs. In particular, the number of allowed shared memory segments is quite small by default.
<P>To increase these limits, edit the file /etc/system (as root), and add the following lines at the end:
<PRE>
set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax=1024000
set shmsys:shminfo_shmseg=32

</PRE>
<P>Then reboot the system for the new limits to take effect.
<P><B>HP-UX:
<P></B>HP-UX 9.0 is also based on System V UNIX, so like Solaris the system kernel should already support shared memory. If you notice shared memory failures in the graphics process, see the HP-UX documentation for assistance in making sure the system kernel has the shared memory capability enabled.
