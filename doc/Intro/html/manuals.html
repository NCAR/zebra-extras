<TITLE> <paranum><B>CHAPTER 1 </B> Guide to Documentation</TITLE>
<H1><A NAME="HDT0"> <paranum><B>CHAPTER 1 </B> Guide to Documentation</A></H1>

<P>This chapter outlines the manuals and information sources available for Zebra. This is a more complete enumeration than the brief information found in the "Whom to Contact" section of the <I>Installation Manual</I>. Also, a large set of help topics is available through Zebra's on-line help interface, which is introduced in <A HREF="iconbar.html#REF21747">Chapter 3</A>.
<H3><A NAME="HDR1">  1.1  Zebra Manuals</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>Below are the manuals for the Zebra system, along with a short decription of each.
<P><B><A HREF="../Release/Release.html">Release Notes</A>

<UL>
<P><LI></B>Originally part of the Installation Manual, the release notes are now a separate document for highlighting the the features, changes, and notable notes about each release.
<BR></UL>


<P><B><A HREF="../Install/Install.html">The Zebra Installation Manual</A>

<UL>
<P><LI></B>This manual provides detailed information about configuring and compiling a Zebra installation.It also includes a list of contacts for problems or questions concerning Zebra.
<BR></UL>


<P><B><A HREF="../AdvUsers/AdvUsers.html">The Zebra Advanced User's Manual</A>


<UL>
<P><LI></B>This document describes the user interface of each of the processes in the Zebra system, from the DataStore daemon and its utilities to the graphics process displays and the multitudinous and multifarious plot description parameters. It is a vital reference for anyone trying to enhance, customize, or troubleshoot a Zebra installation.
<BR></UL>


<P><B><A HREF="../Data/Data.html">The Zebra Data Management Guide</A>

<UL>
<P><LI></B>A guide to assimilating data into the Zebra data store system through ingestor programs, conversion utilities, and write-your-own utilities. It also includes descriptions of supported data formats.  This guide is intended for sites which need to incorporate data which is not already included in an RDP dataset or in a Zebra-supported format.
<BR></UL>


<P><B><A HREF="../Realtime/Realtime.html">A Guide to Realtime Zebra</A>

<UL>
<P><LI></B>This is a guide for sites assimilating data in real-time or through automated and event-driven feeds.  It provides an overview of the many possible real-time host and networking setups, and includes details on running the Zebra programs available for real-time monitoring, diagnostics, and archiving.
<BR></UL>


<P><B><A HREF="../Developer/Developer.html">The Zebra Developer's Guide</A>

<UL>
<P><LI></B>General notes about the Zebra development environment and writing applications using the Zebra libraries. This is the guide to see for information about Zebra's use of the Imake system and about writing and editing Imakefiles for the Zebra development environment.
<BR></UL>


<P><B><A HREF="../Library/Library.html">The Zebra Library Interface Manual</A>

<UL>
<P><LI></B>This is a programming reference manual describing the application interface utilized by all Zebra clients. The Zebra library interface provides access to the message manager, the timer, sound, primitive graphics, and the configuration variables. Anyone attempting to write any type of customized Zebra client should refer to this manual.
<BR></UL>


<P><B><A HREF="../DataStore/DataStore.html">The Zebra DataStore Interface Manual</A>

<UL>
<P><LI></B>The Zebra DataStore provides the data handling capability of Zebra clients. Zebra clients use the library routines to communicate with the DataStore server process and to read and write data files. This is the manual to consult when writing an ingest or data access module.
<BR>
</UL>


<P>Some ancient references to a Configuration Manual may still exist. That manual is now obsolete and has been supplanted by the <I>Advanced User's Manual</I>. Likewise, the DataStore and Library interface manuals are the more complete descendants of the original combined Interface manual.
<P>The Zebra document distribution also includes the <B>Graphics Process Structures and Internals</B> manual. This manual descends from the very original days of Zebra, but its contents are still relevant and useful regarding the implementation of the graphics process. Only programmer's who are considering enhancements or additions to the graphics process need consider reading this manual.
<H3><A NAME="HDR2">  1.2  Where to Find Zebra Documentation</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>The document distribution is available as a separate tar file, with a name such as the following:
<PRE>
Zebra-4.2.doc.tar.gz
</PRE>
<P>See the <I>Installation Manual</I> for details on obtaining the document distribution.
<P>All of the Zebra documentation and online help topics, as well as articles, tutorials, and presentations, are available through the Zebra home page:
<PRE>
<A HREF="http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zebra.html">http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zebra.html</A>
</PRE>
<P>The home page provides access to both the <I>PostScript</I> and HTML formats of the manuals. The hypertext files are also included in the document distribution, as noted in <A HREF="manuals.html#REF40900">Section 1.4, "Hypertext"</A>.
<H3><A NAME="HDR3">  1.3  Hardcopy</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>The <I>PostScript</I> versions of the Zebra manuals can be found in the zebra/doc/ps directory of the Zebra document distribution. To print any of the manuals, first change to that directory. Then you can send the document file directly to a <I>PostScript</I> printer with the appropriate UNIX print command.
<P>For example, use the lpr command under SunOS 4.x and other BSD systems:
<PRE>
lpr -P<I>name</I> <I>file
</PRE>
<P></I>Under Solaris, HP-UX, and other System V systems, use
<PRE>

lp -d<I>name</I> <I>file
</PRE>
<P></I>Where <I>name</I> is the name of the <I>PostScript</I> printer, and <I>file</I> is the name of the manual file to be printed. The README file in the zebra/doc/ps directory lists the files along with the name and size of the document each file contains.
<H3><A NAME="REF40900">  1.4  Hypertext</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>All of the Zebra documentation, except for the <I>Graphics Process Internals</I> manual, also exists in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format. The HTML files reside in the zebra/doc/html directory. Each manual has its own subdirectory, such as AdvUsers or Install. The top-level HTML file in each manual directory is simply the subdirectory name with a `.html' extension, such as AdvUsers.html and Install.html. To browse a manual, use a Web browser's "Open local file" function or put the path to the HTML file on the command line:
<PRE>
% netscape /zebra/doc/html/AdvUsers/AdvUsers.html
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="HDR4">  1.5  Related Documentation</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>The documents below cover Zebra or related software; some may be helpful to anyone wanting further information about the third-party tools utilized by Zebra. In particular, the Unidata netCDF library has gained much popularity, and many applications in the scientific community support it.
