This is the README file for the Zebra documentation directory.  All of
the manuals in this directory are in PostScript format.


Release.ps	-- The Zebra Release Notes.  An overview (about 5 pages) 
		   of recent and past changes.  RELEASE.NOTES in the top
		   directory of the distribution is the ASCII text version.

Install.ps	-- The Zebra Installation Manual, about 50 pages.  
		   The installation steps for binary and source releases,
		   including machine-dependent tips and suggestions.
		   
Intro.ps	-- "Introducing Zebra".  A guide to getting started with
		   Zebra, including the basics of the Zebra start-up script,
		   user customization, and a simple introduction to the
		   online help system.  Much information remains to be added.

AdvUsers.ps	-- The Zebra advanced user's manual, somewhere around 200
		   pages.  Includes details on operating and configuring 
		   all of the essential Zebra processes.  Information on
		   real-time processes and installations has been moved
		   to the "Guide to Realtime Zebra" manual.

Data.ps		-- "Zebra Data Management Guide."  A manual about the data
		   management side of Zebra: file formats, converters,
		   ingestors, and other data utilities.

Realtime.ps	-- "Guide to Realtime Zebra."  Information relevant to 
		   designing, setting up, configuring, and maintaining
		   real-time Zebra projects.

Library.ps	-- The Zebra Library Interface Manual, 70 pages.
		   Describes all of the functions and types available in
		   the Zebra library, including the message manager and
		   timer interfaces, the plot description routines, the
		   graphics widget, and the simpler geographical types 
		   and utilities.

DataStore.ps	-- The Zebra Data Store Interface Manual, 150 pages.
		   Includes the data chunk model and interface, and the
		   data store query, storage, and retrieval interface.

Developer.ps	-- A general reference for those writing Zebra applications.
		   At the moment it mainly contains details on Zebra's
		   Imake implementation and information on setting up 
		   Imakefile's.

overview.ps	-- A 5-page article giving an overview of Zebra.  
		   This file includes a color PostScript raster image of a
		   typical Zebra display, so you can print it only if you
		   have a color PostScript printer or a mono printer which
		   can greyscale or ignore the color image.

gp.ps		-- The Graphics Process Structures and Internals Manual.
		   A 27-page preliminary description of the graphics
		   process internals, for anyone wishing to add plotting
		   capability to the graphics process.  Though very out of
		   date and incomplete, it still gives a useful functional
		   overview of the Zebra graphics process.
		   
gp-index.ps	-- Index to the Graphics Process Internals Manual.
