<TITLE> <paranum><B>CHAPTER 1 </B> Introduction to Real-time Operation</TITLE>
<H1><A NAME="HDT0"> <paranum><B>CHAPTER 1 </B> Introduction to Real-time Operation</A></H1>

<P>This chapter introduces the differences between running Zebra for post-processing and running Zebra for a real-time operation. The features and capabilities of Zebra designed specifically for real-time operation are described and explained in the following chapters. Information about more general use of Zebra can be found in the <I>Advanced User's Guide</I>. Likewise, any capabilities mentioned in this manual but not explained here can probably be found in that same manual. Feel free to suggest specific topics and information to include in this manual.
<P>Essentially this chapter outlines some of the possible setups for a real-time Zebra installation, and then highlights a few of the performance issues for meeting real-time demands.
<P>This manual remains under construction. At the moment some sections are merely placeholders; others have been extracted verbatum from other manuals.
<H3><A NAME="HDR1">  1.1  Networking Zebra Sessions</A></H3>

<HR>

<P>Zebra allows some very complicated setups so that it can be adjusted to the needs of all kinds of field projects and real-time data streams. Processing responsibilities, data, and graphical displays can be distributed among multiple Zebra sessions, running on one host or running on several networked hosts. This section describes some of the basic approaches to designing such setups.
<P>The most important consideration when designing a Zebra network is the distribution of data and the responsibilities for ingesting, processing, and storing that data. Either one data store daemon can be charged with storing and tracking all of the data in the network, or else several daemons can divide up the task. The task can be divided into mutually exclusive sets of platforms, or secondary data stores can maintain copies of the master data store for faster local access. Other alternatives allow data store daemons to share each other's data directories over NFS. The possible combinations are numerous.
<P>The options chosen will depend on the loads on the systems in the network, available disk space, and the requirements for keeping copies of data up-to-date and synchronized with each other.
<H4><A NAME="HDR2">  1.1.1  The Single Datastore Option</A></H4>
<P>A single datastore can serve all of the Zebra sessions and clients on all of the hosts on a network. The datastore directory must be NFS mounted by all of the hosts which require access to the datastore, and the directory path to the datastore must be identical on all hosts. For example, if the datastore directory path is /data on host oscar, then hosts bigbird, bert, and ernie must all mount oscar:/data on a local /data directory.
<P>The master datastore runs in a Zebra session so that other sessions, on the same host or on other hosts, can connect to the datastore daemon client. Clients in remote sessions (i.e., sessions other than the one running the datastore daemon) use the DS_DAEMON_HOST environment variable to specify the name of the session to which datastore connections should be made. See the <I>Advanced User's Manual</I> for more information on DS_DAEMON_HOST.
<H4><A NAME="HDR3">  1.1.2  Remote Datastores</A></H4>
<P>Datastore daemons can also share data directories through a facility called the <I>remote datastore</I>.
<H3><A NAME="HDR4">  1.2  Synchronizing Graphics Displays</A></H3>

<HR>

<P>Graphics displays can be synchronized to data streams and updated in real-time using the <I>trigger</I> parameter. Every graphics window plot description supports a trigger parameter in the global component and each of its overlay components. This section will eventually outline how the graphics process handles triggers.
<H3><A NAME="HDR5">  1.3  Performance Issues</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>This section covers some performance issues relevant to running Zebra in real time.
<H4><A NAME="HDR6">  1.3.1  Radar Rasterization</A></H4>
<P>For projects which must rasterize radar data for display in the Zebra system, the continuous rasterization of real-time radar scans presents a dauning processing task for many workstations. Past real-time Zebra installations have relied on a dedicated rasterizering host. A single Zebra session runs a Rasterizer process and a NetXfr process, which exchange data through the shared memory image transfer routines of the Zebra library. The NetXfr process in turn transmits the rasterized images to a Zebra session running on another host, where the images can be displayed in a graphics process.
<H4><A NAME="HDR7">  1.3.2  Remotely Mounted File Systems</A></H4>
<P>Zebra will work across remote file systems, but there are performance considerations which should be taken into account. First, file access, such as reading data for display in a graphics process window, will be slower across remote file systems. Also, intense remote file access by Zebra translates to higher network traffic.
<P>Real-time Zebra installations should also take note of the DataStore's use of the stat() system call. In situations in which files are updated frequently, on the order of seconds, stat() calls can be a significant time drain. Over remote file systems, the system overhead of the stat() calls is even greater. Whenever possible, keep frequently updated files on local disk space. Also, see the section "File Revisions", in the DataStore chapter of the <I>Zebra Advanced User's Manual</I>.
