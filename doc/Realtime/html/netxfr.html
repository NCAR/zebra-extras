<TITLE> <paranum><B>CHAPTER 4 </B> The Network Transfer Daemon</TITLE>
<H1><A NAME="HDT0"> <paranum><B>CHAPTER 4 </B> The Network Transfer Daemon</A></H1>

<P>The real-time zebra system can include a network transfer daemon, NetXfr, which can transfer data across the network between message manager sessions.
<H3><A NAME="HDR1">  4.1  The network transfer daemon</A></H3>

<HR>
<P>The zebra network transfer daemon (NetXfr) is charged with distributing real time data streams over a network. It is oriented in particular toward the distribution of high-bandwidth data over a local area network, but can be made to work in other environments as well.
<P>NetXfr includes a reliable broadcast protocol for large datasets, so that such data need only be sent over the network once, even if there are several consumers of that data.
<H4><A NAME="HDR2">  4.1.1  Starting NetXfr</A></H4>
<P>NetXfr is invoked as follows:
<PRE>
NetXfr <I>config-file
</PRE>
<P></I>where <I>config-file</I> is the name of NetXfr's configuration file. The configuration of NetXfr can be complicated, and this file is required. The configuration file is read by the RDSS user interface, and so conforms to the usual conventions.

<H4><A NAME="HDR3">  4.1.2  Basic configuration options</A></H4>
<P>A crucial component of every NetXfr configuration file is the definition of the field names that will be used. NetXfr can use the same field definition file as the graphics process, and it is recommended that this be done. Thus, most NetXfr configuration files start with the following line:
<PRE>
read /zeb/lib/FieldDefs
</PRE>
<P>The file name should be substituted with one appropriate for the actual running environment, of course. <I>Note</I> that it is crucial that the same field definition file be used for all invocations of NetXfr on the network, or very strange things can happen. This requirement will be removed at some point in the future.
<P>Most lines in the configuration file are send commands, with the following syntax:
<PRE>
send <I>platform</I> [as <I>plat2</I>] <I>c1</I> <I>c2</I> ...
</PRE>
<P>Where <I>platform</I> is the name of a platform whose data is to be sent, and <I>c1 ...</I> is a list of recipients for this data. If the "as <I>plat2</I>" option is present, the data will be renamed as if it came from <I>plat2</I> before being transferred.
<H4><A NAME="HDR4">  4.1.3  Broadcast protocol configuration</A></H4>
<P>If the NetXfr broadcast protocol is to be used, it must be configured explicitly. The sender of broadcast data needs to have a broadcast command in the configuration file:
<PRE>
broadcast <I>address</I> <I>port
</PRE>
<P></I>Where <I>address</I> is the broadcast address to use (for example, 128.117.80.255), and <I>port</I> is the port number. If you have more than one NetXfr process broadcasting data on the net, you should use a different port number for each.
<P>Recipients of broadcast data need to be told which port number(s) to watch:
<PRE>
receive <I>port
</PRE>
<P></I>NetXfr can monitor more than one broadcast port if need be.

<P>There are a couple of user interface variables which control the workings of the broadcast protocol. The burst variable tells NetXfr how many broadcast packets to dump onto the net before taking a short break to allow recipients to catch up. A typical value is 50. This variable should be set as high as possible, but not so high that NetXfr starts reporting lots of retransmissions.
<P>The ipscan variable tells NetXfr how often, in minutes, the list of in-progress data transmissions should be scanned to get rid of old ones that will (probably) never complete. The usual value is one minute.
<H4><A NAME="HDR5">  4.1.4  Direct image transfer mode</A></H4>
<P>NetXfr can be configured to run in the <I>direct image transfer</I> mode. This is a specialized way of transferring image data through shared memory, avoiding the time that would normally be lost transferring the data to disk and back. To run NetXfr in direct image mode, you need the following configuration line:
<PRE>
dirimage <I>platform
</PRE>
<P></I>Where <I>platform</I> is the name of the platform for which direct image data is to be received. Normally NetXfr will be invoked directly by the image producer (always radar_ingest, currently) when it is to be run in this mode.
<P>See the <I>Zebra Interface Specification and Internals Manual</I> for more information on how direct image transfer works.
<H4><A NAME="HDR6">  4.1.5  How it all works</A></H4>
<P>NetXfr sets itself up as a normal zebra process and data store client. It requests notifications from the daemon for the platforms of interest, fetches the new data when it arrives, and ships it to the recipients by way of the interprocess communication system.
<P>Things get more complicated when the broadcast protocol is involved, however. The purpose of this protocol is high speed for large datasets, so it is important that the data be sent over the network quickly. If NetXfr happens to be writing a piece of data when a set of broadcast packets arrive, it will almost certainly fail to keep up with those packets and some of them will be dropped, making retransmissions necessary.

<P>To avoid this problem, NetXfr splits itself into two processes when it is running as a broadcast recipient. A shared memory segment is created, and the child process devotes itself to grabbing packets off the net and inserting them into this segment. For this reason, the child is called the <I>packet grabber</I> process, and its process name is NetXfr-pg.
<P>NetXfr attempts two priveleged operations in the broadcast recipient mode. The first is to lock the shared memory segment into core memory, so that packets are not lost; second is to run the packet grabber at high priority. For this reason, NetXfr is usually installed as a setuid root program. NetXfr will attempt to run if these operations fail, but it is guaranteed that performance will be badly affected.
<P>Note also that the shared memory segments used by NetXfr when broadcast or direct image mode are being used are fairly large --- larger than is typically allowed in the default Sun kernel. It is necessary to generate a new kernel with a larger value of the SHMSIZE parameter.
<P>If the NetXfr process dies (killed by somebody or maybe even a crash), it will probably be necessary to explicitly kill the packet grabber process before restarting NetXfr.
