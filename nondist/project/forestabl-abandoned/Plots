# Define the set of platforms we watch and the configs and windows
# needed to plot them.  The first field is the platform, followed
# by yes or no for whether the platform is an "observational"
# platform, then the display config and finally the windows in the
# config which should be dumped.
#
# The observation platforms are plotted for each observation rather
# than only the most recent.
