! The file for defining display manager color tables.
! Most color tables are now referenced in .../lib/colortables, except
! for those specific to this project
!
! Later Zeb releases contain a library of colortables which should suffice
! for most configurations.  For the moment, the SGP configuration puts these
! colortables in $CONFIGHOME/colortables and sets CTablePath in dm.config.
! When the $ZEB_TOPDIR/lib/colortables directory exists, ./colortables can
! be erased.  Either way, this file no longer needs to contain any color
! tables which are specific to this project congiruation.
