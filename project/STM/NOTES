The Showcases runtime file should not be version-controlled but generated
from a master version-controlled file only when it is not present.  The
proj_env or proj_startup scripts can copy the master to the runtime file if
the runtime does not exist.  Then there can be an option to reset the
showcases to the master file, or the master can be updated as new cases
need to be moved into the master.


Try using Chris' imagedump changes to periodically dump plots as xwd even
if plot window obscured.  Also try using perusal movie code to raise plot
window and call imagedump on it.
