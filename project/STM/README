This is the README file for the ARM STM/UAV Zebra project configuration.

This Zebra project uses the C preprocessor to generate several
configuration files based on a few parameters which specify the type of
project to be installed.  For example, the project can be setup to default
to either real-time or postprocessing, and the platforms to be defined as
either the set of UAV platforms, SGP platforms, or both.

The ./src directory contains the source files for the C preprocessor.
Those files are processed with cpp then installed over any existing file
in the other project directories.

DO NOT EDIT the files in this directory, or in any subdirectory other than
./src.  If you want to change a file, first check to see whether that file
exists in the ./src directory with a .cpp extension.  If not, then you can
edit the file; otherwise edit the file in ./src.

INSTALLATION:

Change to the ./src directory and edit config.h.  The config.h file
contains a few parameters which must be specified to generate the rest of
the configuration.  The config.h.dist file is just a copy of config.h as it
was distributed.  If necessary config.h can always be reset by overwriting
it with config.h.dist.

	% cd src
	% vi config.h

Once config.h has been edited, create the Makefile using the zmkmf script
in the bin directory of the zebra distribution.  For example, if the
bin directory is in /apps/zebra/bin:

	% /apps/zebra/bin/zmkmf

Then build and install the configuration files:

	% make install

The configuration directory is now ready to use.  Move back to the
parent directory and run zstart:

	% cd ..
	% /apps/zebra/bin/zstart .
