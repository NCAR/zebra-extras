Sonde skew-t plots

		This display comprises one small, horizontal plot window
		and two skew-t windows.  The horizontal plot is sometimes
		called the "map" window since it basically serves as a 
		location reference for the sonde platforms being plotted in
		the skew-t windows.

		A skew-t window can overlay as many as three different
		sonde platforms on the same skew-t.  [It is not yet
		possible to overlay three soundings from different times,
		though they can be looped through quickly using a movie.]
		Each sounding has a platform name and optionally a time in
		the top annotation.  The platform name is an active area to
		which a menu is attached for removing that particular
		sounding from the overlay.  Remove one of the soundings
		from the larger skew-t plot to make room for a different
		one.  On the map window, choose the sonde (wrpn, a1)
		platform from the B6 facility menu.  When the cursor
		becomes a cross-hair, click on the larger skew-t window to
		place the sounding there.

		The cap window contains track plots of two of the sonde
		platforms.  Zoom in on the jumble of graphics above the
		central facility in northern central Oklahoma.  While
		holding the shift button down, press and hold the mouse
		button at the upper left corner of a box around the region
		to zoom.  Drag the mouse to the lower right corner of the
		region and release the mouse and shift buttons.  If you
		zoom far enough the plot will clearly show the track of the
		sonde in the horizontal plane.

		After changing the plot in the window or experimenting with
		the options, the window can be restored to its original
		plot by choosing "reset window" from the window operations
		submenu of the global icon menu ("Z" in lower left corner).
