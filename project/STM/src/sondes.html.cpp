<title>Sonde Skew-t Configuration</title>
<h1>Sonde Skew-t Configuration</h1>

<p>This display comprises one small, <a
href=HELPDIR/horizontal-plots.html>horizontal plot</a> window and two <a
href=HELPDIR/skewt.html>skew-t plot</a> windows.  The horizontal plot is
sometimes called the <em>map</em> window since it basically serves as a
location reference for the sonde platforms being plotted in the skew-t
windows.</p>

<p>A skew-t window can overlay as many as three different sonde platforms
on the same skew-t plot.  [It is not yet possible to overlay three
soundings from different times, though they can be looped through quickly
using a movie.]  Each sounding has a platform name and optionally a time in
the top annotation.  The platform name is an active area to which a menu is
attached for removing that particular sounding from the overlay.</p>

<p>As an example, remove one of the soundings from the larger skew-t plot
to make room for a different one.  On the map window, choose the sonde
(wrpn, a1) platform from the B6 facility menu.  When the cursor becomes a
cross-hair, click on the larger skew-t window to place the sounding
there.</P>

<p>The horizontal window contains track plots of two of the sonde
platforms.  <a href=HELPDIR/zoom.html>Zoom</a> in on the jumble of graphics
above the central facility in northern central Oklahoma.  While holding the
shift button down, press and hold the mouse button at the upper left corner
of a box around the region to zoom.  Drag the mouse to the lower right
corner of the region and release the mouse and shift buttons.  If you zoom
far enough the plot will clearly show the track of the sonde in the
horizontal plane.  The track is color-coded according to particular field,
which can be changed from an icon or annotation field menu. Many other
options are possible for tracks, such as wind vectors and time
annotations.</p>

<p> After changing the plot in the window or experimenting with the
options, a window can be restored to its original plot by choosing
<em>Reset Window</em> from the window operations submenu of the global
icon.  <img src=HELPDIR/zeb-icon.gif</P>
