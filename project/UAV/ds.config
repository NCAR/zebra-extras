! WE USE THIS FILE FOR FAST STARTS WHEN WE ONLY WANT TO BRING ZEB UP TO
! KNOW ABOUT ONE OR A COUPLE OF PLATFORMS.  THIS REDUCED THE TIME NEEDED
! WHEN THE DATASTORE DAEMON INITIALIZES THE DATASTORE.
!
! Data store configuration file.
!
! Platform parameters:
!	organization 	The expected organization of the data
!		3dgrid		three dimensional regular grid
!		2dgrid		two-dimensional regular grid
!		irgrid		two-dimensional irregular grid (PAM)
!		scalar		basic scalar point data
!		outline		Boundaries
!	filetype 	How this data is stored on the disk. Only "netcdf"
!		 	for now; more later.
!			Later: "boundary" works too.
!	keep 		The minimum time period of data to keep on the disk if
!			at all possible.
!	maxsamples 	The maximum number of data samples to put into one
!			disk file.
!	mobile		Indicates that the data collection platform moves
!			through space. For soundings, aircraft.
!	regular		This platform can be expected to return
!			regularly-spaced samples at the given interval.
!	composite	This "platform" is a grouping of several smaller
!			platforms. Only irgrid platforms -- groupings of
!			stationary scalar platforms -- are supported now.
!	discrete	Observations are clumped together into discrete
!			chunks. Used to select the optimal file organization.
!	directory	The directory in which to find data for this
!			platform.
!

!
! Path to the data directory.

set datadir concat(getenv("DATAHOME"), "/sgp/platforms")

! Set to cache upon a normal exit
set CacheOnExit true

! Set to cache every 10 seconds the files that are new
every 120 'cache dirty'

!Set to rescan every 600 seconds for new files in the platform dirs 
!every 30 'rescan all'
every 30 'rescan DsgpblcC1.a1'
