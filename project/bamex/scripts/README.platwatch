Make links to platwatch in this directory as appropriate.
E.g., start_watchers currently assumes existence of 
platwatch.radar_composite, platwatch.goes_1km, etc.
The links can be created as:

	$ ln -s platwatch platwatch.radar_composite
	$ ln -s platwatch platwatch.goes_1km
	...

Unfortunately, such links cannot be checked into CVS, so
they cannot be kept in the repository and just checked
out with the rest of the project.
