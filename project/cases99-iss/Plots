# Define the set of platforms we watch and the configs and windows
# needed to plot them.  The first field is the platform, followed
# by yes or no for whether the platform is an "observational"
# platform, then the display config and finally the windows in the
# config which should be dumped.
#
# The observation platforms are plotted for each observation rather
# than only the most recent.

# Rass are disabled for CASES99, and for now we're only interested in 
# low-mode profiler data.

# As of 0z 10/13, the ISS1 profiler data started coming as high mode, so
# change the platform trigger but keep the "product" name the same
# (prof915l), which is also the display config window to plot (for
# which the platform has also been changed to prof915h).

# Ah hell, let both low and high mode trigger plots so we can just leave
# this alone if iss1 switches back and forth...  But we'll still need
# to change the iss1 display config each switch.
