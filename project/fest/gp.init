! Set some search paths.  'iconpath' includes "./icons" by default,
! so we don't need to set it here.  Likewise 'mappath' includes
! "./maps".  So here we just need to make sure our local modules
! directory is in the require path.
!
set requirepath concat("./modules,",requirepath)

!
! Pull in the compiled widget definitions.
!
set loadfile "gp.lf"
!load #loadfile
read 'gp.widgets'

!
! Set project origin
!
set origin_lat 39.71
set origin_lon -95.53

!
! Get our field definitions.
!
set DefFile (concat (concat (c$libdir, "/"), "FieldDefs"))
read #DefFile

!
! Just about any graphics process will need this, so load it now
! rather than require it everywhere else

require simple-color
