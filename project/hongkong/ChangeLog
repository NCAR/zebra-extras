	* committed hongkong configuration to CVS

Mon May 16 14:13:20 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* TimeSeries.c: fixed a bug in axis tic labels which I introduced
	  in the Solaris port

	* lib: add msg_whoami() function to msg_lib.c, use this to set
	  c$msgname in SetupConfigVariables(), esp for graphics process

	* add x-section template pd, add window bounds to iconbar and
	  global-left menu

	* add active area ISS and sounding locations to iconbar

	* config.h.dist: removed /*/ constructs, inserted default defn
	  for XCOMM, use UNQUOTED_DIRDEFS instead of MAKING_MAKEFILE

	* Ingest state files: changed /rdss/ui/ui_commands to #ui$defs_file

Sat May 14 03:33:19 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* dm: fixed bug in KillProcess which would accidentally remove
	  windows from a configuration; added 'reuse' and 'rename' options
	  to dm newwindow command, rename generates unique window names 
	  automatically

	* IconBar: use 'rename' option to newwindow in create-window

Fri May 13 23:59:03 1994  Gary Granger  (granger@kodiak)

	* IconBar: changed sendout ro_radar to putc1; changed config menu
	  to use ellipses and provide direct saving and 'save as'

	* added atd.config for running stand-alone on stout clients

	* gp: fixed station plots to correlate with side annotation
	  quadrant active areas

	* modules/global: added do_side_annot_size menu used by station
	  library pd

Thu Apr 28 04:56:19 1994  Gary Granger  (lantex@owsu1)

	* Installed the cutting-edge Zeb version, including platform
	  classes and single-file configuration saves.

	* Modified ds.config to use platform classes where useful.

	* Cleaned out /zeb/data_store/hongkong/iss.  ISS soundings
	  now called 'class' to match directory name being used.
	  May require some configuration changes.

	* Split zebstart into start_datastore and zebstart.
	  start_datastore starts the message handler, timer, daemon,
	  and the zeb ingest processes.  zebstart restarts only
	  the display manager.  start_realtime runs start_datastore
	  and start_zeb_aux_ingest.  The start_realtime script is run
	  from /etc/rc.user at boot time.

	* start_event_logger, zeb_window, and start_realtime all
	  available on olwm menu.

	* More configuration work.  Split global menus and procedures
	  into modules/global and require'd it in gp.init.

	* Installed RasterPlot.c fix for upside-down images.  
	  Re-converted all of the ro_sat images.

Fri Apr 22 00:49:59 1994  Gary Granger  (lantex@owsu1)

	* Removed (or at least tried to) all dependencies on 
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  It is no longer set in .cshrc, and is 
	  explicitly unset in zeb_window.  RDSS libraries were compiled
	  without it, using gcc.  Zeb shouldn't need it, though it might
	  not hurt for the whole tree to be re-compiled with the new 
	  RDSS libraries and making sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset.
	  
	* ROSatImageIngest.c, overlay.c: Image lines go from high
	  latitudes to low latitudes, while image grid expected to go
	  from low to high.  So I reversed the order scan lines are
	  placed into the image data, and this has fixed the upside-down
	  satellite images (must have been a bug before which showed
	  the images right-side-up).  All of the image files archived in
	  /zeb/data_ingest/archive/ro_sat were re-ingested with the
	  new ingestor.

	* Added exit codes to class_ingest and interpret those codes in
	  ingest_realtime_soundings.perl.

Thu Apr 21 21:33:30 1994  Gary Granger  (lantex@owsu1)

	* ds.config: Commented out procedure cleanup since not used at
	  the moment and there was no CleanUp procedure for it to call,
	  which caused the daemon to crash two hours into execution.
	  CleanupScan and DoTruncate procedures added, but not set-up
	  for correct platforms or times, and it won't be used until
	  procedure cleanup is un-commented.

	* ds.config: Commented the lantau/prof platform, since it didn't
	  have a data directory and hence kept causing warning messages.

Thu Apr 21 12:55:05 1994  Gary Granger  (lantex@owsu1)

	* The ping protocol seems to be very mixed-up.
	  message.c: MTAP case moved *above* MT_PING so that pings which
	  fall through don't fall into MT_TAP.  Accept both MT_PING and
	  MT_CPING for pings to the message handler, since the handler 
	  checks for its own name anyway.  
	  zmon.c and msg_ping.c: Send MT_CPING in all cases, regardless
	  of whether pinging a message client or the handler itself.  Zmon
	  now accepts redundant host and process names in the config file,
	  such as the config file written for this project in 
	  /zeb/project/hongkong/zmon.config.

	* '/' in platform names replaced with '-' to get cache file names.

	* Fixed the Archiver: tar command line now limited to what fits
	  into the command line buffer

	* ConfigVars.c: tries Basedir/project/ZEB_PROJECT first, and if no
	  access tries Basedir/ZEB_PROJECT, and finally resorts to "." if
	  necessary.  Changed zebstart to set ZEB_PROJECT to "hongkong".
	  The project directory is used by Archiver to locate the
	  DumpedFiles file.

	* Ingest source directories copied to new Zeb source tree, cleaned
	  out, Imakefile's updated, and programs recompiled and re-installed.
	  Now possible to build and install all of the ingest programs used
	  for the hongkong project by doing 'make install' in /zeb/src/ingest.


Wed Apr 20 12:08:17 1994  Gary Granger  (lantex@owsu1)

	* netcdf library and include files installed under /zeb/netcdf

	* EventLogger now starts up in window manager mode and by default
	  saves log messages to the file $ZEBHOME/zeb.logfile (both
	  zebstart and start_eventlogger changed).

	* FORTRAN SC2.0.1 found in /usr/local/lang-2.0/SC2.0.1.

	* X found in /usr/local/x11r5/{lib,include}

	* Zeb source on stout tagged TAG_LANTEX_940420, tarred, and
	  ftp'ed to owsu1.

	* Moved new.bin, new.lib, bin_4, bin, lib, local_lib, and local_bin
	  underneath /zeb/backup.  After enough testing, these can all
	  be deleted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes for future reference: 

It would be nice to separate the display menu in the iconbar into a
separate file which could be changed automatically as new displays are
saved.  Users could have the option of adding recently-saved
configurations to the iconbar menu.

When installing a read-only source tree (as is created by tarfile: target
under stout:/zeb), the install target fails in src/etc/icons if the icon
files have been installed once before, because the existing installed
files do not have write permission.  Changing to 'install' works, and
doing a 'rm $(LIBDIR)/icons/[a-z]*' is probably not a good idea.  Maybe do
'foreach icon ([a-z]*); rm -f $(LIBDIR)/icons/$icon; cp $icon
$(LIBDIR)/icons; end'.
