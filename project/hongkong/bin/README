STARTING AND RUNNING ZEB
========================

                           ** WARNING **

  DO NOT RESTART THE DATA STORE UNLESS YOU HAVE READ THIS AND
              UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!

BASIC STARTUP
-------------

The script start_zeb_datastore_and_ingest starts up the data store and
the ingest processes. This is run on bootup using rc.user. If something
goes wrong it may be rerun from the openwin menu.

The zeb datastore must be running at all times, along with the ingest
processes. These are necessary to ensure that the incoming data is
ingested, stored and archived.

The archiver must be started up from the menu once the windowing system
is up. In the Archiver window select 'Take tape'. The archiver uses
/dev/nrst9, a high-density, no-rewind device. If the tape has been
rewound and new tape should be inserted.

The EventLogger should also be started up from the menu.

DISPLAY
-------

The display may be started and killed without interfering with the
data store and the ingest processes. The display is started from the
openwin menu.

NOTE: This message window will be removed after 3 minutes.
