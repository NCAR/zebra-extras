#	Version:	1.0
#	Date:	        March 12, 1994
#
#	define the directory storing fresh data and that for archival
#
set datadir="/zeb/data_ingest/aws"
set archivedir="/zeb/data_ingest/archive/aws/`date +%y%m%d`"
#
#	move the data files to the appropriate directory for further 
#	data archival
#
#	first copy the tail of each file to a tmp directory, then
#	move the file, then mv the tail back in. This is because the
#	ingest program requires some history.
#
#	modified the script to compress the files prior to moving
#	time. This will save space on disk since the files now
#	contain one second wind data. 9/19/94 GMC.
