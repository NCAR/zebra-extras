# Begin the minimal set of realtime processes for keeping data
# ingest going.  This is the script which gets run as user 'lantex'
# from the rc.user script.  Two things are required: the Zeb
# datastore and the Zeb ingest processes, and the polling scripts
# which check for data files and ingest them as they appear.  The
# polling scripts do not need Zeb running, and so they should continue
# forever.  The Zeb ingest processes will die if the datastore crashes or
# 'zebstop' is run.  They can be restarted with 'start_zeb_ingest'.

# To start this script from rc.user, remember to execute the script
# from a login shell as user lantex, since all of these scripts need
# the lantex environment settings (such as ZEB_HOME).
#
# su - lantex -c "/zeb/project/hongkong/bin/start_zeb_datastore_and_ingest \
#      >& /dev/console"
#

# This script can also be run from the command-line, but be aware
# (i.e., 'beware') that it will kill *everything* first.
