On Jun-23-1995, LT4 was successfully relocated from Tung Chung Au to
Nei Lak Shan (so there are two AWS stations on Nei Lak Shan now).
However, the data collected at the new site was still being sent to the
file "stalt4.dat", and displayed on Zeb as LT4.

In order to avoid confusion, a new station "LT9", was added to Zeb on
Jul-07-1995.  The raw data is now directed to "stalt9.dat", and ingested
data is now displaying at the new site - Nei Lak Shan.  LT4 remains on
Zeb without any data feeding to it.
