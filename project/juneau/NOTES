Documentation of CVS Tags for this project
------------------------------------------

Project_Juneau: 1.1.1

	The vendor branch onto which Chris copy of the project, from
	/zeb/chris/juneau, was first imported.

Tag_Juneau_Import: 1.1.1.1

	The tag for the initial import, which corresponds to the copy
	in /zeb/chris/juneau as of 25 March 1997.

Tag_Merged_JNU_NWS_970325:

	The point at which the copy of the project on jnu_wind, as of 25
	March 1997, was merged into the trunk.  The project version with
	this tag is almost an exact copy of the version copied from
	jnu_wind, except for a couple changes made in /zeb/chris/juneau
	which looked like they needed to be kept. (I think an example is a
	call to dc_DestroyDC in one of the derivation programs.)

	This is also the point after which Gary started making changes and
	adding the profiler display.
