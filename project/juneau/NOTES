Documentation of CVS Tags for this project
------------------------------------------

Project_Juneau: 1.1.1

	The vendor branch onto which Chris copy of the project, from
	/zeb/chris/juneau, was first imported.

Tag_Juneau_Import: 1.1.1.1

	The tag for the initial import, which corresponds to the copy
	in /zeb/chris/juneau as of 25 March 1997.

Tag_Merged_JNU_NWS_970325:

	The point at which the copy of the project on jnu_wind, as of 25
	March 1997, was merged into the trunk.  The project version with
	this tag is almost an exact copy of the version copied from
	jnu_wind, except for a couple changes made in /zeb/chris/juneau
	which looked like they needed to be kept. (I think an example is a
	call to dc_DestroyDC in one of the derivation programs.)

	This is also the point after which Gary started making changes and
	adding the profiler display.

Added icons/sheep_mount_x link to makelinks.  Added ./modules to require
path in gp.init.

Added prof_atd/prof915l platform to ds.config and to LastData.config.
Copied iss and iss-new modules from coare config into juneau/modules.
Created profiler display configuration and added two new windows using
rass-template and wind-template library plot descriptions.  Edited the
window pd's, changing the platforms and a few other parameters.  Saved the
configuration as dconfig/profiler.dc.

Added test in dm.config for 'jadmin' project, which is just a link to
'juneau' project directory.  It chooses the gp init file and iconbar and
other settings according to whether we're running the restricted,
operational configuration or the administration configuration.  It would be
nice, though, if we could leave the iconbar size unspecified in display
configurations so that it can choose a default size.  All we really need
for the icon bar is a location and an orientation (h or v).  The size
should be whatever fits.

The restricted gp.init pre-empts the modules and icons paths with the
respective directories under ./restricted.  So far only the global icon is
overridden, with a copy of the 'tiny' bitmap.  Likewise the admin gp.init
prepends the admin paths, but those don't actually contain anything extra
at the moment.

dm.config loads the IconBar in either ./admin or ./restricted, depending on
the value of the Admin variable.  The correct gp.init argument is picked by
setting the Default and Graphic process prototypes in DisplayConfigs.  Note
that those definitions take precedence over the 'fallback' prototypes in
the .dc files.

Tag_NWS_Test_970327:

	The version used for NWS testing on jnu_term and jnu_wind on the
	morning of 27 Mar 1997.

Things to do after 11:30, 970327 NWS test:

   x	remove the airport window in the "all" configuration

   x	make sure zebra icon appear in space between windows

   x	lower wind plot by about 50 pixels to make room for system xclock

   x	leave data-skip on wind plot at 1, though it was originally set
	there accidentally

   x	popup time control window automatically, preferrably around space
	between windows so that either "System Time" shows through or the
	real time and set time buttons

   x	add time control to zebra iconbar menu

   x	leave the time/title in the wind plot top annotation

   x	add time-height-winds menu to right button (already on left)

   x	add menu options for plotting barbs in knots and choosing between
	every point and every other point

	send changes to jnu_wind in juneau.3 and update ~zuser/.xinitrc
	before 16:00 today


Bug in xywind module: setting data-skip to 1 plots every *other* point
rather than every point.

Its possible to raise time and iconbar above graphics windows with this
dm command:

	shell "(sleep 5; zrun Displaymgr 'popup time; popup iconbar') &"

The problem is not knowing how long the delay should be.

Look into why zebra slow to startup on jnu_term.  Even though datastore
large, cache files should exist.  Is daemon trusting the stat times in the
cache?  Should it?  Or is the delay in merely stat()'ing each file to see
if its mtime differs from the cache?

We could set each file constant, which means new files will be found, but
not the most recent data in those files, so we could still be several hours
off without a rescan.

Tag_NWS_970327_3:

	Version installed on jnu_wind under project directory juneau.3
