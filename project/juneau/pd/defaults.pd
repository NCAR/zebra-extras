! Icons to use for various platforms.  The icons themselves can be created
! using the X Window "bitmap" utility, and saved in the <project>/icons 
! directory.  In general, it is good to have a separate icon for each platform.
! Example:
!
!	cp2-icon:		cp2
!	goes-icon:		goes
!
	null-icon:		null
!
! Will you be using tracks of mobile platforms?  If so, it can be useful
! to assign a special color to each one.
!
! Example:
!	electra-color:		orange
!	kingair-color:		cyan
!
	null-color:		white
!
! Add named locations to your heart's delight.
