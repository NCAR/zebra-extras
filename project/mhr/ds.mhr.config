! Data store configuration file.
!
! Platform parameters:
!	organization 	The expected organization of the data
!		3dgrid		three dimensional regular grid
!		2dgrid		two-dimensional regular grid
!		irgrid		two-dimensional irregular grid (PAM)
!		scalar		basic scalar point data
!		outline		Boundaries
!	filetype 	How this data is stored on the disk.  Only "netcdf"
!		 	for now; more later.
!			Later: "boundary" works too.
!	keep 		The minimum time period of data to keep on the disk if
!			at all possible.
!	maxsamples 	The maximum number of data samples to put into one
!		      	disk file.
!	mobile		Indicates that the data collection platform moves
!			through space.  For soundings, aircraft.
!	regular		This platform can be expected to return
!			regularly-spaced samples at the given interval.
!	composite	This "platform" is a grouping of several smaller
!			platforms.  Only irgrid platforms -- groupings of
!			stationary scalar platforms -- are supported now.
!	discrete	Observations are clumped together into discrete
!			chunks.  Used to select the optimal file organization.
!	directory	The directory in which to find data for this
!			platform.
!

! The default minimum keep period.
