			Tangerine Shutdown Procedure
			============================

o Press the [Free tape] button in the Archiver widget.  The tape will be 
  rewound and eventually ejected from the drive.  Remove the tape from the
  drive, flip the write-protect tab, and put the tape away.

o Move to the SPRINT window (if SPRINT is running) and kill it by typing a 
  <Control-C>.

o Shut down Zebra from any free window:

	tangerine $ zstop

o Exit the window system, using the "Exit" entry in the root window, left 
  mouse button menu.  All windows should go away at this point, and you 
  will be left with a console prompt.

o Logout:

	tangerine $ exit
