			Tangerine Startup Procedure
			===========================



o Log in as "zebra":

		console login: zebra
		Password: _zebra

                          |
                          this is a "space" character


o Start X:

		tangerine $ xinit

o From any free terminal window, start up Zebra software:

		tangerine $ zstart scms

  All of the necessary pieces of Zebra should start at this point.
  The window layout should now look like Figure 1.

o Label and load a blank tape for Zebra's data store archive.  Wait
  until the drive is ready (i.e., is displaying one solid green light),
  then press the [Take tape] button in the Archiver widget.

o The system should now be set for normal daily operations.

		tangerine $ xinit

o Make sure Zebra is already running on tangerine, since that is the
  "master" data store machine for all displays.  From any free 
  terminal window, start up Zebra software:

		tangerine $ zstart scms

  All of the necessary pieces of Zebra should start at this point.
